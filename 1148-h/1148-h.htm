<h1><span class="smcap">The Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin
through Wales</span><br />
by<br />
Giraldus Cambrensis</h1>
<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald the Welshman</span>&mdash;Giraldus
Cambrensis&mdash;was born, probably in 1147, at Manorbier Castle
in the county of Pembroke.&nbsp; His father was a Norman noble,
William de Barri, who took his name from the little island of
Barry off the coast of Glamorgan.&nbsp; His mother, Angharad, was
the daughter of Gerald de Windsor <a name="citation0a"></a><a
href="#footnote0a" class="citation">[0a]</a> by his wife, the
famous Princess Nesta, the &ldquo;Helen of Wales,&rdquo; and the
daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr Mawr, the last independent Prince of
South Wales.</p>
<p>Gerald was therefore born to romance and adventure.&nbsp; He
was reared in the traditions of the House of Dinevor.&nbsp; He
heard the brilliant and pitiful stories of Rhys ap Tewdwr, who,
after having lost and won South Wales, died on the stricken field
fighting against the Normans, an old man of over fourscore years;
and of his gallant son, Prince Rhys, who, after wrenching his
patrimony from the invaders, died of a broken heart a few months
after his wife, the Princess Gwenllian, had fallen in a skirmish
at Kidwelly.&nbsp; No doubt he heard, though he makes but sparing
allusion to them, of the loves and adventures of his grandmother,
the Princess Nesta, the daughter and sister of a prince, the wife
of an adventurer, the concubine of a king, and the paramour of
every daring lover&mdash;a Welshwoman whose passions embroiled
all Wales, and England too, in war, and the mother of
heroes&mdash;Fitz-Geralds, Fitz-Stephens, and Fitz-Henries, and
others&mdash;who, regardless of their mother&rsquo;s eccentricity
in the choice of their fathers, <a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>united like brothers in the most
adventurous undertaking of that age, the Conquest of Ireland.</p>
<p>Though his mother was half Saxon and his father probably fully
Norman, Gerald, with a true instinct, described himself as a
&ldquo;Welshman.&rdquo;&nbsp; His frank vanity, so na&iuml;ve as
to be void of offence, his easy acceptance of everything which
Providence had bestowed on him, his incorrigible belief that all
the world took as much interest in himself and all that appealed
to him as he did himself, the readiness with which he adapted
himself to all sorts of men and of circumstances, his credulity
in matters of faith and his shrewd common sense in things of the
world, his wit and lively fancy, his eloquence of tongue and pen,
his acute rather than accurate observation, his scholarship
elegant rather than profound, are all characteristic of a certain
lovable type of South Walian.&nbsp; He was not blind to the
defects of his countrymen any more than to others of his
contemporaries, but the Welsh he chastised as one who loved
them.&nbsp; His praise followed ever close upon the heels of his
criticism.&nbsp; There was none of the rancour in his references
to Wales which defaces his account of contemporary Ireland.&nbsp;
He was acquainted with Welsh, though he does not seem to have
preached it, and another archdeacon acted as the interpreter of
Archbishop Baldwin&rsquo;s Crusade sermon in Anglesea.&nbsp; But
he could appreciate the charm of the <i>Cynghanedd</i>, the
alliterative assonance which is still the most distinctive
feature of Welsh poetry.&nbsp; He cannot conceal his sympathy
with the imperishable determination of his countrymen to keep
alive the language which is their <i>differentia</i> among the
nations of the world.&nbsp; It is manifest in the story which he
relates at the end of his &ldquo;Description of
Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; Henry II. asked an old Welshman of Pencader
in Carmarthenshire if the Welsh could resist his might.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This nation, O King,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;may
often be weakened and in great part destroyed by the power of
yourself and of <a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>others, but many a time, as it deserves, it will rise
triumphant.&nbsp; But never will it be destroyed by the wrath of
man, unless the wrath of God be added.&nbsp; Nor do I think that
any other nation than this of Wales, or any other tongue,
whatever may hereafter come to pass, shall on the day of the
great reckoning before the Most High Judge, answer for this
corner of the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prone to discuss with his
&ldquo;Britannic frankness&rdquo; the faults of his countrymen,
he cannot bear that any one else should do so.&nbsp; In the
&ldquo;Description of Wales&rdquo; he breaks off in the middle of
a most unflattering passage concerning the character of the Welsh
people to lecture Gildas for having abused his own
countrymen.&nbsp; In the preface to his &ldquo;Instruction of
Princes,&rdquo; he makes a bitter reference to the prejudice of
the English Court against everything Welsh&mdash;&ldquo;Can any
good thing come from Wales?&rdquo;&nbsp; His fierce Welshmanship
is perhaps responsible for the unsympathetic treatment which he
has usually received at the hands of English historians.&nbsp;
Even to one of the writers of Dr. Traill&rsquo;s &ldquo;Social
England,&rdquo; Gerald was little more than &ldquo;a strong and
passionate Welshman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes it was his pleasure to pose as a citizen of the
world.&nbsp; He loved Paris, the centre of learning, where he
studied as a youth, and where he lectured in his early
manhood.&nbsp; He paid four long visits to Rome.&nbsp; He was
Court chaplain to Henry II.&nbsp; He accompanied the king on his
expeditions to France, and Prince John to Ireland.&nbsp; He
retired, when old age grew upon him, to the scholarly seclusion
of Lincoln, far from his native land.&nbsp; He was the friend and
companion of princes and kings, of scholars and prelates
everywhere in England, in France, and in Italy.&nbsp; And yet
there was no place in the world so dear to him as
Manorbier.&nbsp; Who can read his vivid description of the old
castle by the sea&mdash;its ramparts blown upon by the winds that
swept over the Irish Sea, its fishponds, its garden, and its
lofty nut trees&mdash;without feeling that here, after all, <a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>was the home of
Gerald de Barri?&nbsp; &ldquo;As Demetia,&rdquo; he said in his
&ldquo;Itinerary,&rdquo; &ldquo;with its seven cantreds is the
fairest of all the lands of Wales, as Pembroke is the fairest
part of Demetia, and this spot the fairest of Pembroke, it
follows that Manorbier is the sweetest spot in
Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has left us a charming account of his
boyhood, playing with his brothers on the sands, they building
castles and he cathedrals, he earning the title of &ldquo;boy
bishop&rdquo; by preaching while they engaged in boyish
sport.&nbsp; On his last recorded visit to Wales, a broken man,
hunted like a criminal by the king, and deserted by the ingrate
canons of St. David&rsquo;s, he retired for a brief respite from
strife to the sweet peace of Manorbier.&nbsp; It is not known
where he died, but it is permissible to hope that he breathed his
last in the old home which he never forgot or ceased to love.</p>
<p>He mentions that the Welsh loved high descent and carried
their pedigree about with them.&nbsp; In this respect also Gerald
was Welsh to the core.&nbsp; He is never more pleased than when
he alludes to his relationship with the Princes of Wales, or the
Geraldines, or Cadwallon ap Madoc of Powis.&nbsp; He hints, not
obscurely, that the real reason why he was passed over for the
Bishopric of St. David&rsquo;s in 1186 was that Henry II. feared
his <i>natio et cognatio</i>, his nation and his family.&nbsp; He
becomes almost dithyrambic in extolling the deeds of his kinsmen
in Ireland.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are they who penetrated into the
fastnesses of the enemy?&nbsp; The Geraldines.&nbsp; Who are they
who hold the country in submission?&nbsp; The Geraldines.&nbsp;
Who are they whom the foemen dread?&nbsp; The Geraldines.&nbsp;
Who are they whom envy would disparage?&nbsp; The
Geraldines.&nbsp; Yet fight on, my gallant kinsmen,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Felices facti si quid mea carmina
possuit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gerald was satisfied, not only with his birthplace and
lineage, but with everything that was his.&nbsp; He makes
complacent references to his good looks, which he had <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>inherited
from Princess Nesta.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it possible so fair a youth
can die?&rdquo; asked Bishop, afterwards Archbishop, Baldwin,
when he saw him in his student days. <a name="citation0b"></a><a
href="#footnote0b" class="citation">[0b]</a>&nbsp; Even in his
letters to Pope Innocent he could not refrain from repeating a
compliment paid to him on his good looks by Matilda of St.
Valery, the wife of his neighbour at Brecon, William de
Braose.&nbsp; He praises his own unparalleled generosity in
entertaining the poor, the doctors, and the townsfolk of Oxford
to banquets on three successive days when he read his
&ldquo;Topography of Ireland&rdquo; before that university.&nbsp;
As for his learning he records that when his tutors at Paris
wished to point out a model scholar they mentioned Giraldus
Cambrensis.&nbsp; He is confident that though his works, being
all written in Latin, have not attained any great contemporary
popularity, they will make his name and fame secure for
ever.&nbsp; The most precious gift he could give to Pope Innocent
III., when he was anxious to win his favour, was six volumes of
his own works; and when good old Archbishop Baldwin came to
preach the Crusade in Wales, Gerald could think of no better
present to help beguile the tedium of the journey than his own
&ldquo;Topography of Ireland.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is equally pleased
with his own eloquence.&nbsp; When the archbishop had preached,
with no effect, for an hour, and exclaimed what a hardhearted
people it was, Gerald moved them almost instantly to tears.&nbsp;
He records also that John Spang, the Lord Rhys&rsquo;s fool, said
to his master at Cardigan, after Gerald had been preaching the
Crusade, &ldquo;You owe a great debt, O Rhys, to your kinsman,
the archdeacon, who has taken a hundred or so of your men to
serve the Lord; for if he had only spoken in Welsh, you would not
have had a soul left.&rdquo;&nbsp; His works are full of
appreciations of Gerald&rsquo;s reforming zeal, his
administrative energy, his unostentatious and scholarly life.</p>
<p>Professor Freeman in his &ldquo;Norman Conquest&rdquo;
described <a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>Gerald as &ldquo;the father of comparative
philology,&rdquo; and in the preface to his edition of the last
volume of Gerald&rsquo;s works in the Rolls Series, he calls him
&ldquo;one of the most learned men of a learned age,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the universal scholar.&rdquo;&nbsp; His range of subjects
is indeed marvellous even for an age when to be a
&ldquo;universal scholar&rdquo; was not so hopeless of attainment
as it has since become.&nbsp; Professor Brewer, his earliest
editor in the Rolls Series, is struck by the same
characteristic.&nbsp; &ldquo;Geography, history, ethics,
divinity, canon law, biography, natural history, epistolary
correspondence, and poetry employed his pen by turns, and in all
these departments of literature he has left memorials of his
ability.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without being Ciceronian, his Latin was far
better than that of his contemporaries.&nbsp; He was steeped in
the classics, and he had, as Professor Freeman remarks,
&ldquo;mastered more languages than most men of his time, and had
looked at them with an approach to a scientific view which still
fewer men of his time shared with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He quotes
Welsh, English, Irish, French, German, Hebrew, Latin, and Greek,
and with four or five of these languages at least he had an
intimate, scholarly acquaintance.&nbsp; His judgment of men and
things may not always have been sound, but he was a shrewd
observer of contemporary events.&nbsp; &ldquo;The cleverest
critic of the life of his time&rdquo; is the verdict of Mr.
Reginald Poole. <a name="citation0c"></a><a href="#footnote0c"
class="citation">[0c]</a>&nbsp; He changed his opinions often: he
was never ashamed of being inconsistent.&nbsp; In early life he
was, perhaps naturally, an admirer of the Angevin dynasty; he
lived to draw the most terrible picture extant of their lives and
characters.&nbsp; During his lifetime he never ceased to inveigh
against Archbishop Hubert Walter; after his death he repented and
recanted.&nbsp; His invective was sometimes coarse, and his abuse
was always virulent.&nbsp; He was not over-scrupulous in his
methods of controversy; but no one can rise from a reading of his
works without <a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiii</span>a feeling of liking for the vivacious, cultured,
impulsive, humorous, irrepressible Welshman.&nbsp; Certainly no
Welshman can regard the man who wrote so lovingly of his native
land, and who championed her cause so valiantly, except with real
gratitude and affection.</p>
<p>But though it is as a writer of books that Gerald has become
famous, he was a man of action, who would have left, had Fate
been kinder, an enduring mark on the history of his own time, and
would certainly have changed the whole current of Welsh religious
life.&nbsp; As a descendant of the Welsh princes, he took himself
seriously as a Welsh patriot.&nbsp; Destined almost from his
cradle, both by the bent of his mind and the inclination of his
father, to don &ldquo;the habit of religion,&rdquo; he could not
join Prince Rhys or Prince Llewelyn in their struggle for the
political independence of Wales.&nbsp; His ambition was to become
Bishop of St. David&rsquo;s, and then to restore the Welsh Church
to her old position of independence of the metropolitan authority
of Canterbury.&nbsp; He detested the practice of promoting
Normans to Welsh sees, and of excluding Welshmen from high
positions in their own country.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because I am a
Welshman, am I to be debarred from all preferment in
Wales?&rdquo; he indignantly writes to the Pope.&nbsp;
Circumstances at first seemed to favour his ambition.&nbsp; His
uncle, David Fitz-Gerald, sat in the seat of St.
David&rsquo;s.&nbsp; When the young scholar returned from Paris
in 1172, he found the path of promotion easy.&nbsp; After the
manner of that age&mdash;which Gerald lived to denounce&mdash;he
soon became a pluralist.&nbsp; He held the livings of Llanwnda,
Tenby, and Angle, and afterwards the prebend of Mathry, in
Pembrokeshire, and the living of Chesterton in Oxfordshire.&nbsp;
He was also prebendary of Hereford, canon of St. David&rsquo;s,
and in 1175, when only twenty-eight years of age, he became
Archdeacon of Brecon.&nbsp; In the following year Bishop David
died, and Gerald, together with the other archdeacons of the
diocese, was nominated by the chapter for the king&rsquo;s
choice.&nbsp; <a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiv</span>But the chapter had been premature, urged, no doubt, by
the impetuous young Archdeacon of Brecon.&nbsp; They had not
waited for the king&rsquo;s consent to the nomination.&nbsp; The
king saw that his settled policy in Wales would be overturned if
Gerald became Bishop of St. David&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Gerald&rsquo;s
cousin, the Lord Rhys, had been appointed the king&rsquo;s
justiciar in South Wales.&nbsp; The power of the Lord Marches was
to be kept in check by a quasi-alliance between the Welsh prince
and his over-lord.&nbsp; The election of Gerald to the greatest
see in Wales would upset the balance of power.&nbsp; David
Fitz-Gerald, good easy man (<i>vir su&acirc; sorte contentus</i>
is Gerald&rsquo;s description of him), the king could tolerate,
but he could not contemplate without uneasiness the combination
of spiritual and political power in South Wales in the hands of
two able, ambitious, and energetic kinsmen, such as he knew
Gerald and the Lord Rhys to be.&nbsp; Gerald had made no secret
of his admiration for the martyred St. Thomas &agrave;
Becket.&nbsp; He fashioned himself upon him as Becket did on
Anselm.&nbsp; The part which Becket played in England he would
like to play in Wales.&nbsp; But the sovereign who had destroyed
Becket was not to be frightened by the canons of St.
David&rsquo;s and the Archdeacon of Brecon.&nbsp; He summoned the
chapter to Westminster, and compelled them in his presence to
elect Peter de Leia, the Prior of Wenlock, who erected for
himself an imperishable monument in the noble cathedral which
looks as if it had sprung up from the rocks which guard the city
of Dewi Sant from the inrush of the western sea.</p>
<p>It is needless to recount the many activities in which Gerald
engaged during the next twenty-two years.&nbsp; They have been
recounted with humorous and affectionate appreciation by Dr.
Henry Owen in his monograph on &ldquo;Gerald the Welshman,&rdquo;
a little masterpiece of biography which deserves to be better
known. <a name="citation0d"></a><a href="#footnote0d"
class="citation">[0d]</a>&nbsp; In <a name="pagexv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xv</span>1183 Gerald was employed by the
astute king to settle terms between him and the rebellious Lord
Rhys.&nbsp; Nominally as a reward for his successful diplomacy,
but probably in order to keep so dangerous a character away from
the turbulent land of Wales, Gerald was in the following year
made a Court chaplain.&nbsp; In 1185 he was commissioned by the
king to accompany Prince John, then a lad of eighteen, who had
lately been created &ldquo;Lord of Ireland,&rdquo; to the city of
Dublin.&nbsp; There he abode for two years, collecting materials
for his two first books, the &ldquo;Topography&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Conquest of Ireland.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1188 he accompanied
Archbishop Baldwin through Wales to preach the Third
Crusade&mdash;not the first or the last inconsistency of which
the champion of the independence of the Welsh Church was
guilty.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Itinerary through Wales&rdquo; is the
record of the expedition.&nbsp; King Richard offered him the
Bishopric of Bangor, and John, in his brother&rsquo;s absence,
offered him that of Llandaff.&nbsp; But his heart was set on St.
David&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In 1198 his great chance came to him.&nbsp;
At last, after twenty-two years of misrule, Peter de Leia was
dead, and Gerald seemed certain of attaining his heart&rsquo;s
desire.&nbsp; Once again the chapter nominated Gerald; once more
the royal authority was exerted, this time by Archbishop Hubert,
the justiciar in the king&rsquo;s absence, to defeat the
ambitious Welshman.&nbsp; The chapter decided to send a
deputation to King Richard in Normandy.&nbsp; The deputation
arrived at Chinon to find Coeur-de-Lion dead; but John was
anxious to make friends everywhere, in order to secure himself on
his uncertain throne.&nbsp; He received the deputation
graciously, he spoke in praise of Gerald, and he agreed to accept
the nomination.&nbsp; But after his return to England John
changed his mind.&nbsp; He found that no danger threatened him in
his island kingdom, and he saw the wisdom of the
justiciar&rsquo;s policy.&nbsp; Gerald hurried to see him, but
John point blank refused publicly to ratify his consent to the
nomination which he had already given <a name="pagexvi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>in private.&nbsp; Then commenced the
historic fight for St. David&rsquo;s which, in view of the still
active &ldquo;Church question&rdquo; in Wales, is even now
invested with a living interest and significance.&nbsp; Gerald
contended that the Welsh Church was independent of Canterbury,
and that it was only recently, since the Norman Conquest, that
she had been deprived of her freedom.&nbsp; His opponents relied
on political, rather than historical, considerations to defeat
this bold claim.&nbsp; King Henry, when a deputation from the
chapter in 1175 appeared before the great council in London and
had urged the metropolitan claims of St. David&rsquo;s upon the
Cardinal Legate, exclaimed that he had no intention of giving
this head to rebellion in Wales.&nbsp; Archbishop Hubert, more of
a statesman than an ecclesiastic, based his opposition on similar
grounds.&nbsp; He explained his reasons bluntly to the
Pope.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unless the barbarity of this fierce and
lawless people can be restrained by ecclesiastical censures
through the see of Canterbury, to which province they are subject
by law, they will be for ever rising in arms against the king, to
the disquiet of the whole realm of England.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Gerald&rsquo;s answer to this was complete, except from the point
of view of political expediency.&nbsp; &ldquo;What can be more
unjust than that this people of ancient faith, because they
answer force by force in defence of their lives, their lands, and
their liberties, should be forthwith separated from the body
corporate of Christendom, and delivered over to Satan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story of the long fight between Gerald on the one hand and
the whole forces of secular and ecclesiastical authority on the
other cannot be told here.&nbsp; Three times did he visit Rome to
prosecute his appeal&mdash;alone against the world.&nbsp; He had
to journey through districts disturbed by wars, infested with the
king&rsquo;s men or the king&rsquo;s enemies, all of whom
regarded Gerald with hostility.&nbsp; He was taken and thrown
into prison as King John&rsquo;s subject in one town, he was
detained by <a name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvii</span>importunate creditors in another, and at Rome he was
betrayed by a countryman whom he had befriended.&nbsp; He himself
has told us</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
the most disastrous chances<br />
Of moving accidents by flood and field,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which made a journey from St. David&rsquo;s to Rome a more
perilous adventure in those unquiet days than an expedition
&ldquo;through darkest Africa&rdquo; is in ours.&nbsp; At last
the very Chapter of St. David&rsquo;s, for whose ancient rights
he was contending, basely deserted him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The laity of
Wales stood by me,&rdquo; so he wrote in later days, &ldquo;but
of the clergy whose battle I was fighting scarce
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pope Innocent III. was far too wary a
politician to favour the claims of a small and distracted nation,
already half-subjugated, against the king of a rich and powerful
country.&nbsp; He flattered our poor Gerald, he delighted in his
company, he accepted, and perhaps even read, his books.&nbsp; But
in the end, after five years&rsquo; incessant fighting, the
decision went against him, and the English king&rsquo;s nominee
has ever since sat on the throne of St. David&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Many and great wars,&rdquo; said Gwenwynwyn, the Prince of
Powis, &ldquo;have we Welshmen waged with England, but none so
great and fierce as his who fought the king and the archbishop,
and withstood the might of the whole clergy and people of
England, for the honour of Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Short was the memory and scant the gratitude of his
countrymen.&nbsp; When in 1214 another vacancy occurred at a time
when King John was at variance with his barons and his prelates,
the Chapter of St. David&rsquo;s nominated, not Gerald, their old
champion, but Iorwerth, the Abbot of Talley, from whose reforming
zeal they had nothing to fear.&nbsp; This last prick of
Fortune&rsquo;s sword pierced Gerald to the quick.&nbsp; He had
for years been gradually withdrawing from an active life.&nbsp;
He had resigned his archdeaconry and his prebend stall, he had
made a fourth pilgrimage, this time for his soul&rsquo;s <a
name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>sake,
to Rome, he had retired to a quiet pursuit of letters probably at
Lincoln, and henceforward, till his death about the year 1223, he
devoted himself to revising and embellishing his old works, and
completing his literary labours.&nbsp; By his fight for St.
David&rsquo;s he had endeared himself to the laity of his country
for all time.&nbsp; The saying of Llewelyn the Great was
prophetic.&nbsp; &ldquo;So long as Wales shall stand by the
writings of the chroniclers and by the songs of the bards shall
his noble deed be praised throughout all time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
prophecy has not yet been verified.&nbsp; Welsh chroniclers have
made but scanty references to Gerald; no bard has ever yet sung
an <i>Awdl</i> or a <i>Pryddest</i> in honour of him who fought
for the &ldquo;honour of Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; His countrymen have
forgotten Gerald the Welshman.&nbsp; It has been left to Sir
Richard Colt Hoare, Foster, Professor Brewer, Dimmock, and
Professor Freeman to edit his works.&nbsp; Only two of his
countrymen have attempted to rescue one of the greatest of
Welshmen from an undeserved oblivion.&nbsp; In 1585, when the
Renaissance of Letters had begun to rouse the dormant powers of
the Cymry, Dr. David Powel edited in Latin a garbled version of
the &ldquo;Itinerary&rdquo; and &ldquo;Description of
Wales,&rdquo; and gave a short and inaccurate account of
Gerald&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; In 1889 Dr. Henry Owen published,
&ldquo;at his own proper charges,&rdquo; the first adequate
account by a Welshman of the life and labours of Giraldus
Cambrensis.&nbsp; When his monument is erected in the cathedral
which was built by his hated rival, the epitaph which he composed
for himself may well be inscribed upon it&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Cambria Giraldus genuit, sic Cambria mentem<br />
Erudiit, cineres cui lapis iste tegit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And by that time perhaps some competent scholar will have
translated some at least of Gerald&rsquo;s works into the
language best understood by the people of Wales.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to exaggerate the enormous services
which three great Welshmen of the twelfth <a
name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>century
rendered to England and to the world&mdash;such services as we
may securely hope will be emulated by Welshmen of the next
generation, now that we have lived to witness what Mr. Theodore
Watts-Dunton has called &ldquo;the great recrudescence of Cymric
energy.&rdquo; <a name="citation0e"></a><a href="#footnote0e"
class="citation">[0e]</a>&nbsp; The romantic literature of
England owes its origin to Geoffrey of Monmouth; <a
name="citation0f"></a><a href="#footnote0f"
class="citation">[0f]</a> Sir Galahad, the stainless knight, the
mirror of Christian chivalry, as well as the nobler portions of
the Arthurian romance, were the creation of Walter Map, the
friend and &ldquo;gossip&rdquo; of Gerald; <a
name="citation0g"></a><a href="#footnote0g"
class="citation">[0g]</a> and John Richard Green has truly called
Gerald himself &ldquo;the father of popular literature.&rdquo; <a
name="citation0h"></a><a href="#footnote0h"
class="citation">[0h]</a>&nbsp; He began to write when he was
only twenty; he continued to write till he was past the allotted
span of life.&nbsp; He is the most &ldquo;modern&rdquo; as well
as the most voluminous of all the medi&aelig;val writers.&nbsp;
Of all English writers, Miss Kate Norgate <a
name="citation0i"></a><a href="#footnote0i"
class="citation">[0i]</a> has perhaps most justly estimated the
real place of Gerald in English letters.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gerald&rsquo;s wide range of subjects,&rdquo; she says,
&ldquo;is only less remarkable than the ease and freedom with
which he treats them.&nbsp; Whatever he touches&mdash;history,
arch&aelig;ology, geography, natural science, politics, the
social life and thought of the day, the physical peculiarities of
Ireland and the manners and customs of its people, the
picturesque scenery and traditions of his own native land, the
scandals of the court and the cloister, the petty struggle for
the primacy of Wales, and the great tragedy of the fall of the
Angevin Empire&mdash;is all alike dealt with in the bold,
dashing, offhand <a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xx</span>style of a modern newspaper or magazine article.&nbsp;
His first important work, the &lsquo;Topography of
Ireland,&rsquo; is, with due allowance for the difference between
the tastes of the twelfth century and those of the nineteenth,
just such a series of sketches as a special correspondent in our
own day might send from some newly-colonised island in the
Pacific to satisfy or whet the curiosity of his readers at
home.&rdquo;&nbsp; The description aptly applies to all that
Gerald wrote.&nbsp; If not a historian, he was at least a great
<a name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxi</span>journalist.&nbsp; His descriptions of Ireland have been
subjected to much hostile criticism from the day they were
written to our own times.&nbsp; They were assailed at the time,
as Gerald himself tells us, for their unconventionality, for
their departure from established custom, for the freedom and
colloquialism of their style, for the audacity of their stories,
and for the writer&rsquo;s daring in venturing to treat the
manners and customs of a barbarous country as worthy the
attention of the learned and the labours of the historian.&nbsp;
Irish scholars, from the days of Dr. John Lynch, who published
his &ldquo;Cambrensis Eversus&rdquo; in 1622, have unanimously
denounced the work of the sensational journalist, born out of due
time.&nbsp; His Irish books are confessedly partisan; the
&ldquo;Conquest of Ireland&rdquo; was expressly designed as an
eulogy of &ldquo;the men of St. David&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the
writer&rsquo;s own kinsmen.&nbsp; But in spite of partisanship
and prejudice, they must be regarded as a serious and valuable
addition to our knowledge of the state of Ireland at the latter
end of the twelfth century.&nbsp; Indeed, Professor Brewer does
not hesitate to say that &ldquo;to his industry we are
exclusively indebted for all that is known of the state of
Ireland during the whole of the Middle Ages,&rdquo; and as to the
&ldquo;Topography,&rdquo; Gerald &ldquo;must take rank with the
first who descried the value and in some respects the limits of
descriptive geography.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he came to deal with the affairs of state on a larger
stage, his methods were still that of the modern
journalist.&nbsp; He was always an impressionist, a writer of
personal sketches.&nbsp; His character sketches of the
Plantagenet princes&mdash;of King Henry with his large round head
and fat round belly, his fierce eyes, his tigerish temper, his
learning, his licentiousness, his duplicity, and of Eleanor of
Aquitaine, his vixenish and revengeful wife, the murderess of
&ldquo;Fair Rosamond&rdquo; (who must have been known to Gerald,
being the daughter of Walter of Clifford-on-the-Wye), and of the
fierce brood that they reared&mdash;are of extraordinary
interest.&nbsp; His impressions of the men and events of his
time, his fund of anecdotes and <i>bon mots</i>, his references
to trivial matters, which more dignified writers would never
deign to mention, his sprightly and sometimes malicious gossip,
invest his period with a reality which the greatest of
fiction-writers has failed to rival.&nbsp; Gerald lived in the
days of chivalry, days which have been crowned with a halo of
deathless romance by the author of &ldquo;Ivanhoe&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Talisman.&rdquo;&nbsp; He knew and was intimate with all
the great actors of the time.&nbsp; He had lived in the Paris of
St. Louis and Philip Augustus, and was never tired of exalting
the House of Capet over the tyrannical and bloodthirsty House of
Anjou.&nbsp; He had no love of England, for her Plantagenet kings
or her Saxon serfs.&nbsp; During the French invasion in the time
of King John his sympathies were openly with the Dauphin as
against the &ldquo;brood of vipers,&rdquo; who were equally alien
to English soil.&nbsp; For the Saxon, indeed, he felt the twofold
hatred of Welshman and Norman.&nbsp; One of his opponents is
denounced to the Pope as an &ldquo;untriwe Sax,&rdquo; and the
Saxons are described as the slaves of the Normans, the mere
hewers of wood and drawers of water for their conquerors.&nbsp;
He met Innocent III., the greatest of Popes, in familiar
converse, he jested and gossiped with him in slippered ease, he
made him laugh at his endless stories of the glory of Wales, the
iniquities of the Angevins, and the bad Latin of Archbishop
Walter.&nbsp; He <a name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxii</span>knew Richard C&oelig;ur-de-Lion, the flower of
chivalry, and saw him as he was and &ldquo;not through a glass
darkly.&rdquo;&nbsp; He knew John, the cleverest and basest of
his house.&nbsp; He knew and loved Stephen Langton, the precursor
of a long line of statesmen who have made English liberty
broad&mdash;based upon the people&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; He was a
friend of St. Hugh of Lincoln, the sweetest and purest spirit in
the Anglican Church of the Middle Ages, the one man who could
disarm the wrath of the fierce king with a smile; and he was the
friend and patron of Robert Grosstete, afterwards the great
Bishop of Lincoln.&nbsp; He lived much in company with Ranulph de
Glanville, the first English jurist, and he has
&ldquo;Boswellised&rdquo; some of his conversations with
him.&nbsp; He was intimate with Archbishop Baldwin, the saintly
prelate who laid down his life in the Third Crusade on the
burning plains of Palestine, heart-broken at the unbridled
wickedness of the soldiers of the Cross.&nbsp; He was the near
kinsman and confidant of the Cambro-Normans, who, landing in
Leinster in 1165, effected what may be described as the first
conquest of Ireland.&nbsp; There was scarcely a man of note in
his day whom he had not seen and conversed with, or of whom he
does not relate some piquant story.&nbsp; He had travelled much,
and had observed closely.&nbsp; Probably the most valuable of all
his works, from the strictly historical point of view, are the
&ldquo;Itinerary&rdquo; and &ldquo;Description of Wales,&rdquo;
which are reprinted in the present volume. <a
name="citation0j"></a><a href="#footnote0j"
class="citation">[0j]</a>&nbsp; Here he is impartial in his
evidence, and judicial in his decisions.&nbsp; If he errs at all,
it is not through racial prejudice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
sprung,&rdquo; he once told the Pope in a letter, &ldquo;from the
princes of Wales and from the barons of the Marches, and when I
see injustice in either race, I hate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The text is that of Sir Richard Colt Hoare, who published an
English translation, chiefly from the texts of Camden and
Wharton, in 1806.&nbsp; The valuable historical notes have been
curtailed, as being too elaborate for <a
name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxiii</span>such a
volume as this, and a few notes have been added by the present
editor.&nbsp; These will be found within brackets.&nbsp;
Hoare&rsquo;s translation, and also translations (edited by Mr.
Foster) of the Irish books have been published in Bohn&rsquo;s
Antiquarian Library.</p>
<p>The first of the seven volumes of the Latin text of Gerald,
published in the Rolls Series, appeared in 1861.&nbsp; The first
four volumes were edited by Professor Brewer; the next two by Mr.
Dimmock; and the seventh by Professor Freeman.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the more important of the works of
Gerald:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Topographia Hibernica, Expugnatio Hibernica,
Itinerarium Kambri&aelig;, Descriptio Kambri&aelig;, Gemma
Ecclesiastica, Libellus Invectionum, De Rebus a se Gestis,

<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>FIRST
PREFACE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO STEPHEN LANGTON, ARCHBISHOP OF
CANTERBURY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the times are affected by the
changes of circumstances, so are the minds of men influenced by
different manners and customs.&nbsp; The satirist [Persius]
exclaims,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mille hominum species et mentis discolor
usus;<br />
Velle suum cuique est, nec voto vivitur uno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nature is ever various in her name;<br />
Each has a different will, and few the same.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comic poet also says, &ldquo;<i>Quot capita tot
sententi&aelig;</i>, <i>suus cuique mos est</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;As many men, so many minds, each has his way.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Young soldiers exult in war, and pleaders delight in the gown;
others aspire after riches, and think them the supreme
good.&nbsp; Some approve Galen, some Justinian.&nbsp; Those who
are desirous of honours follow the court, and from their
ambitious pursuits meet with more mortification than
satisfaction.&nbsp; Some, indeed, but very few, take pleasure in
the liberal arts, amongst whom we cannot but admire logicians,
who, when they have made only a trifling progress, are as much
enchanted with the images of Dialectics, as if they were
listening to the songs of the Syrens.</p>
<p>But among so many species of men, where are to be found divine
poets?&nbsp; Where the noble assertors of morals?&nbsp; Where the
masters of the Latin tongue?&nbsp; Who in the present times
displays lettered eloquence, either in history or poetry?&nbsp;
Who, I say, in our own age, either builds a system of ethics, or
consigns illustrious <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>actions to immortality?&nbsp; Literary fame, which used
to be placed in the highest rank, is now, because of the
depravity of the times, tending to ruin and degraded to the
lowest, so that persons attached to study are at present not only
not imitated nor venerated, but even detested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Happy
indeed would be the arts,&rdquo; observes Fabius, &ldquo;if
artists alone judged of the arts;&rdquo; but, as Sydonius says,
&ldquo;it is a fixed principle in the human mind, that they who
are ignorant of the arts despise the artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But to revert to our subject.&nbsp; Which, I ask, have
rendered more service to the world, the arms of Marius or the
verses of Virgil?&nbsp; The sword of Marius has rusted, while the
fame of him who wrote the &AElig;neid is immortal; and although
in his time letters were honoured by lettered persons, yet from
his own pen we find,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&mdash;
&mdash; tantum<br />
Carmina nostra valent tela inter Martia, quantum<br />
Chaonias dicunt, aquila veniente, columbas.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who would hesitate in deciding which are more profitable, the
works of St. Jerom, or the riches of Cr&oelig;sus? but where now
shine the gold and silver of Cr&oelig;sus? whilst the world is
instructed by the example and enlightened by the learning of the
poor c&oelig;nobite.&nbsp; Yet even he, through envy, suffered
stripes and contumely at Rome, although his character was so
illustrious; and at length being driven beyond the seas, found a
refuge for his studies in the solitude of Bethlehem.&nbsp; Thus
it appears, that gold and arms may support us in this life, but
avail nothing after death; and that letters through envy profit
nothing in this world, but, like a testament, acquire an immortal
value from the seal of death.</p>
<p>According to the poet,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pascitur in vivis livor, post fata
quiescit;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cum suus ex merito quemque tuetur
honor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Denique si quis adhuc pr&aelig;tendit
nubila, livor<br />
Occidet, et meriti post me referentur honores.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Those who
by artifice endeavour to acquire or preserve the reputation of
abilities or ingenuity, while they abound in the words of others,
have little cause to boast of their own inventions.&nbsp; For the
composers of that polished language, in which such various cases
as occur in the great body of law are treated with such an
appropriate elegance of style, must ever stand forward in the
first ranks of praise.&nbsp; I should indeed have said, that the
authors of refined language, not the hearers only, the inventors,
not the reciters, are most worthy of commendation.&nbsp; You will
find, however, that the practices of the court and of the schools
are extremely similar; as well in the subtleties they employ to
lead you forward, as in the steadiness with which they generally
maintain their own positions.&nbsp; Yet it is certain that the
knowledge of logic (the <i>acumen</i>, if I may so express it, of
all other sciences as well as arts) is very useful, when
restricted within proper bounds; whilst the court (<i>i.e.</i>
courtly language), excepting to sycophants or ambitious men, is
by no means necessary.&nbsp; For if you are successful at court,
ambition never wholly quits its hold till satiated, and allures
and draws you still closer; but if your labour is thrown away,
you still continue the pursuit, and, together with your
substance, lose your time, the greatest and most irretrievable of
all losses.&nbsp; There is likewise some resemblance between the
court and the game of dice, as the poet observes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sic ne perdiderit non cessat perdere
lusor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dum revocat cupidas alea blanda
manus;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which, by substituting the word <i>curia</i> for <i>alea</i>,
may be applied to the court.&nbsp; This further proof of their
resemblance may be added; that as the chances of the dice and
court are not productive of any real delight, so they are equally
distributed to the worthy and the unworthy.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, among so many species of men, each follows
his own inclination, and each is actuated by different desires, a
regard for posterity has induced me <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>to choose the study of composition;
and, as this life is temporary and mutable, it is grateful to
live in the memory of future ages, and to be immortalized by
fame; for to toil after that which produces envy in life, but
glory after death, is a sure indication of an elevated
mind.&nbsp; Poets and authors indeed aspire after immortality,
but do not reject any present advantages that may offer.</p>
<p>I formerly completed with vain and fruitless labour the
Topography of Ireland for its companion, the king Henry the
Second, and Vaticinal History, for Richard of Poitiou, his son,
and, I wish I were not compelled to add, his successor in vice;
princes little skilled in letters, and much engaged in
business.&nbsp; To you, illustrious Stephen, archbishop of
Canterbury, equally commendable for your learning and religion, I
now dedicate the account of our meritorious journey through the
rugged provinces of Cambria, written in a scholastic style, and
divided into two parts.&nbsp; For as virtue loves itself, and
detests what is contrary to it, so I hope you will consider
whatever I may have written in commendation of your late
venerable and eminent predecessor, with no less affection than if
it related to yourself.&nbsp; To you also, when completed, I
destine my treatise on the Instruction of a Prince, if, amidst
your religious and worldly occupations, you can find leisure for
the perusal of it.&nbsp; For I purpose to submit these and other
fruits of my diligence to be tasted by you at your discretion,
each in its proper order; hoping that, if my larger undertakings
do not excite your interest, my smaller works may at least merit
your approbation, conciliate your favour, and call forth my
gratitude towards you; who, unmindful of worldly affections, do
not partially distribute your bounties to your family and
friends, but to letters and merit; you, who, in the midst of such
great and unceasing contests between the crown and the
priesthood, stand forth almost singly the firm and faithful
friend of the British church; you, who, almost the only one duly
elected, fulfil the scriptural designation of the episcopal
character.&nbsp; It is not, however, <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>by bearing a cap, by placing a
cushion, by shielding off the rain, or by wiping the dust, even
if there should be none, in the midst of a herd of flatterers,
that I attempt to conciliate your favour, but by my
writings.&nbsp; To you, therefore, rare, noble, and illustrious
man, on whom nature and art have showered down whatever becomes
your supereminent situation, I dedicate my works; but if I fail
in this mode of conciliating your favour, and if your prayers and
avocations should not allow you sufficient time to read them, I
shall consider the honour of letters as vanished, and in hope of
its revival I shall inscribe my writings to posterity.</p>
<h2><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>SECOND
PREFACE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO THE SAME PRELATE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> those things, which are known
to have been done through a laudable devotion, are not unworthily
extolled with due praises; and since the mind, when relaxed,
loses its energy, and the torpor of sloth enervates the
understanding, as iron acquires rust for want of use, and
stagnant waters become foul; lest my pen should be injured by the
rust of idleness, I have thought good to commit to writing the
devout visitation which Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, made
throughout Wales; and to hand down, as it were in a mirror,
through you, O illustrious Stephen, to posterity, the difficult
places through which we passed, the names of springs and
torrents, the witty sayings, the toils and incidents of the
journey, the memorable events of ancient and modern times, and
the natural history and description of the country; lest my study
should perish through idleness, or the praise of these things be
lost by silence.</p>

ITINERARY THROUGH WALES<br />
BOOK I</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">JOURNEY THROUGH HEREFORD AND
RADNOR</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1188 from the
incarnation of our Lord, Urban the Third <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a> being the head of the apostolic see;
Frederick, emperor of Germany and king of the Romans; Isaac,
emperor of Constantinople; Philip, the son of Louis, reigning in
France; Henry the Second in England; William in Sicily; Bela in
Hungary; and Guy in Palestine: in that very year, when Saladin,
prince of the Egyptians and Damascenes, by a signal victory
gained possession of the kingdom of Jerusalem; Baldwin,
archbishop <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>of Canterbury, a venerable man, distinguished for his
learning and sanctity, journeying from England for the service of
the holy cross, entered Wales near the borders of
Herefordshire.</p>
<p>The archbishop proceeded to Radnor, <a
name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a> on Ash Wednesday (<i>Caput
Jejunii</i>), accompanied by Ranulph de Glanville, privy
counsellor and justiciary of the whole kingdom, and there met
Rhys, <a name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a> son of Gruffydd, prince of South
Wales, and many other noble personages of those parts; where a
sermon being preached by the archbishop, upon the subject of the
Crusades, and explained to the Welsh by an interpreter, the
author of this Itinerary, impelled by the urgent importunity and
promises of the king, and the persuasions of the archbishop and
the justiciary, arose the first, and falling down at the feet of
the holy man, devoutly took the sign of the cross.&nbsp; His
example was instantly followed by Peter, bishop of St.
David&rsquo;s, <a name="citation12c"></a><a href="#footnote12c"
class="citation">[12c]</a> a monk of the abbey of Cluny, and then
by Eineon, son of Eineon Clyd, <a name="citation12d"></a><a
href="#footnote12d" class="citation">[12d]</a> prince of Elvenia,
and many other persons.&nbsp; Eineon rising up, said to Rhys,
whose daughter he had married, &ldquo;My father and lord! with
your permission I hasten to revenge the injury offered to the
great father of all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rhys himself was so fully
determined upon the holy <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>peregrination, as soon as the
archbishop should enter his territories on his return, that for
nearly fifteen days he was employed with great solicitude in
making the necessary preparations for so distant a journey; till
his wife, and, according to the common vicious licence of the
country, his relation in the fourth degree, Guendolena,
(Gwenllian), daughter of Madoc, prince of Powys, by female
artifices diverted him wholly from his noble purpose; since, as
Solomon says, &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s heart deviseth his way, but
the Lord directeth his steps.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Rhys before his
departure was conversing with his friends concerning the things
he had heard, a distinguished young man of his family, by name
Gruffydd, and who afterwards took the cross, is said thus to have
answered: &ldquo;What man of spirit can refuse to undertake this
journey, since, amongst all imaginable inconveniences, nothing
worse can happen to any one than to return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the arrival of Rhys in his own territory, certain canons of
Saint David&rsquo;s, through a zeal for their church, having
previously secured the interest of some of the prince&rsquo;s
courtiers, waited on Rhys, and endeavoured by every possible
suggestion to induce him not to permit the archbishop to proceed
into the interior parts of Wales, and particularly to the
metropolitan see of Saint David&rsquo;s (a thing hitherto unheard
of), at the same time asserting that if he should continue his
intended journey, the church would in future experience great
prejudice, and with difficulty would recover its ancient dignity
and honour.&nbsp; Although these pleas were most strenuously
urged, the natural kindness and civility of the prince would not
suffer them to prevail, lest by prohibiting the
archbishop&rsquo;s progress, he might appear to wound his
feelings.</p>
<p>Early on the following morning, after the celebration of mass,
and the return of Ranulph de Glanville to England, we came to
Cruker Castle, <a name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a> two miles distant from <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Radnor, where
a strong and valiant youth named Hector, conversing with the
archbishop about taking the cross, said, &ldquo;If I had the
means of getting provisions for one day, and of keeping fast on
the next, I would comply with your advice;&rdquo; on the
following day, however, he took the cross.&nbsp; The same
evening, Malgo, son of Cadwallon, prince of Melenia, after a
short but efficacious exhortation from the archbishop, and not
without the tears and lamentations of his friends, was marked
with the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>But here it is proper to mention what happened during the
reign of king Henry the First to the lord of the castle of
Radnor, in the adjoining territory of Builth, <a
name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a> who had entered the church of Saint
Avan (which is called in the British language Llan Avan), <a
name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a> and, without sufficient caution or
reverence, had passed the night there with his hounds.&nbsp;
Arising early in the morning, according to the custom of hunters,
he found his hounds mad, and himself struck blind.&nbsp; After a
long, dark, and tedious existence, he was conveyed to Jerusalem,
happily taking care that his inward sight should not in a similar
manner be extinguished; and there being accoutred, and led to the
field of battle on horseback, he made a spirited attack upon the
enemies of the faith, and, being mortally wounded, closed his
life with honour.</p>
<p>Another circumstance which happened in these our days, in the
province of Warthrenion, <a name="citation14c"></a><a
href="#footnote14c" class="citation">[14c]</a> distant from <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>hence only a
few furlongs, is not unworthy of notice.&nbsp; Eineon, lord of
that district, and son-in-law to prince Rhys, who was much
addicted to the chase, having on a certain day forced the wild
beasts from their coverts, one of his attendants killed a hind
with an arrow, as she was springing forth from the wood, which,
contrary to the nature of her sex, was found to bear horns of
twelve years&rsquo; growth, and was much fatter than a stag, in
the haunches as well as in every other part.&nbsp; On account of
the singularity of this circumstance, the head and horns of this
strange animal were destined as a present to king Henry the
Second.&nbsp; This event is the more remarkable, as the man who
shot the hind suddenly lost the use of his right eye, and being
at the same time seized with a paralytic complaint, remained in a
weak and impotent state until the time of his death.</p>
<p>In this same province of Warthrenion, and in the church of
Saint Germanus, <a name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a> there is a staff of Saint Cyric, <a
name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b"
class="citation">[15b]</a> covered on all sides with gold and
silver, and resembling in its upper part the form of a cross; its
efficacy has been proved in many cases, but particularly in the
removal of glandular and strumous swellings; insomuch that all
persons <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>afflicted with these complaints, on a devout application
to the staff, with the oblation of one penny, are restored to
health.&nbsp; But it happened in these our days, that a strumous
patient on presenting one halfpenny to the staff, the humour
subsided only in the middle; but when the oblation was completed
by the other halfpenny, an entire cure was accomplished.&nbsp;
Another person also coming to the staff with the promise of a
penny, was cured; but not fulfilling his engagement on the day
appointed, he relapsed into his former disorder; in order,
however, to obtain pardon for his offence, he tripled the
offering by presenting three-pence, and thus obtained a complete
cure.</p>
<p>At Elevein, in the church of Glascum, <a
name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a"
class="citation">[16a]</a> is a portable bell, endowed with great
virtues, called Bangu, <a name="citation16b"></a><a
href="#footnote16b" class="citation">[16b]</a> and said to have
belonged to Saint David.&nbsp; A certain woman secretly conveyed
this bell to her husband, who was confined in the castle of
Raidergwy, <a name="citation16c"></a><a href="#footnote16c"
class="citation">[16c]</a> near Warthrenion, (which Rhys, son of
Gruffydd, had lately built) for the purpose of his
deliverance.&nbsp; The keepers of the castle not only refused to
liberate him for this consideration, but seized and detained the
bell; and in the same night, by divine vengeance, the whole town,
except the wall on which the bell hung, was consumed by fire.</p>
<p>The church of Luel, <a name="citation16d"></a><a
href="#footnote16d" class="citation">[16d]</a> in the
neighbourhood of Brecheinoc <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>(<i>Brechinia</i>), was burned, also
in our time, by the enemy, and everything destroyed, except one
small box, in which the consecrated host was deposited.</p>
<p>It came to pass also in the province of Elvenia, which is
separated from Hay by the river Wye, in the night in which king
Henry I. expired, that two pools <a name="citation17"></a><a
href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a> of no small extent,
the one natural, the other artificial, suddenly burst their
bounds; the latter, by its precipitate course down the
declivities, emptied itself; but the former, with its fish and
contents, obtained a permanent situation in a valley about two
miles distant.&nbsp; In Normandy, a few days before the death of
Henry II., the fish of a certain pool near Seez, five miles from
the castle of Exme, fought during the night so furiously with
each other, both in the water and out of it, that the
neighbouring people were attracted by the noise to the spot; and
so desperate was the conflict, that scarcely a fish was found
alive in the morning; thus, by a wonderful and unheard-of
prognostic, foretelling the death of one by that of many.</p>
<p>But the borders of Wales sufficiently remember and abhor the
great and enormous excesses which, from ambitious usurpation of
territory, have arisen amongst brothers and relations in the
districts of Melenyth, Elvein, and Warthrenion, situated between
the Wye and the Severn.</p>
<h2><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">JOURNEY THROUGH HAY AND
BRECHEINIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> crossed the river Wye, we
proceeded towards Brecheinoc, and on preaching a sermon at Hay,
<a name="citation18a"></a><a href="#footnote18a"
class="citation">[18a]</a> we observed some amongst the
multitude, who were to be signed with the cross (leaving their
garments in the hands of their friends or wives, who endeavoured
to keep them back), fly for refuge to the archbishop in the
castle.&nbsp; Early in the morning we began our journey to
Aberhodni, and the word of the Lord being preached at Landeu, <a
name="citation18b"></a><a href="#footnote18b"
class="citation">[18b]</a> we there spent the night.&nbsp; The
castle and chief town of the province, situated where the river
Hodni joins the river Usk, is called Aberhodni; <a
name="citation18c"></a><a href="#footnote18c"
class="citation">[18c]</a> and every place where one river falls
into another is called Aber in the British tongue.&nbsp; Landeu
signifies the church of God.&nbsp; <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>The archdeacon of that place
(Giraldus) presented to the archbishop his work on the Topography
of Ireland, which he graciously received, and either read or
heard a part of it read attentively every day during his journey;
and on his return to England completed the perusal of it.</p>
<p>I have determined not to omit mentioning those occurrences
worthy of note which happened in these parts in our days.&nbsp;
It came to pass before that great war, in which nearly all this
province was destroyed by the sons of Jestin, <a
name="citation19a"></a><a href="#footnote19a"
class="citation">[19a]</a> that the large lake, and the river
Leveni, <a name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b"
class="citation">[19b]</a> which flows from it into the Wye,
opposite Glasbyry, <a name="citation19c"></a><a
href="#footnote19c" class="citation">[19c]</a> were tinged with a
deep green colour.&nbsp; The old people of the country were
consulted, and answered, that a short time before the great
desolation <a name="citation19d"></a><a href="#footnote19d"
class="citation">[19d]</a> caused by Howel, son of Meredyth, the
water had been coloured in a similar manner.&nbsp; About the same
time, a chaplain, whose name was Hugo, being engaged to officiate
at the chapel of Saint Nicholas, in the castle of Aberhodni, saw
in a dream a venerable man standing near him, and saying,
&ldquo;Tell thy lord William de Braose, <a
name="citation19e"></a><a href="#footnote19e"
class="citation">[19e]</a> who has the audacity <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>to retain the
property granted to the chapel of Saint Nicholas for charitable
uses, these words: &lsquo;The public treasury takes away that
which Christ does not receive; and thou wilt then give to an
impious soldier, what thou wilt not give to a
priest.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This vision having been repeated
three times, he went to the archdeacon of the place, at Landeu,
and related to him what had happened.&nbsp; The archdeacon
immediately knew them to be the words of Augustine; and shewing
him that part of his writings where they were found, explained to
him the case to which they applied.&nbsp; He reproaches persons
who held back tithes and other ecclesiastical dues; and what he
there threatens, certainly in a short time befell this withholder
of them: for in our time we have duly and undoubtedly seen, that
princes who have usurped ecclesiastical benefices (and
particularly king Henry the Second, who laboured under this vice
more than others), have profusely squandered the treasures of the
church, and given away to hired soldiers what in justice should
have been given only to priests.</p>
<p>Yet something is to be said in favour of the aforesaid William
de Braose, although he greatly offended in this particular (since
nothing human is perfect, and to have knowledge of all things,
and in no point to err, is an attribute of God, not of man); for
he always placed the name of the Lord before his sentences,
saying, &ldquo;Let this be done in the name of the Lord; let that
be done by God&rsquo;s will; if it shall please God, or if God
grant leave; it shall be so by the grace of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
learn from Saint <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>Paul, that everything ought thus to be committed and
referred to the will of God.&nbsp; On taking leave of his
brethren, he says, &ldquo;I will return to you again, if God
permit;&rdquo; and Saint James uses this expression, &ldquo;If
the Lord will, and we live,&rdquo; in order to show that all
things ought to be submitted to the divine disposal.&nbsp; The
letters also which William de Braose, as a rich and powerful man,
was accustomed to send to different parts, were loaded, or rather
honoured, with words expressive of the divine indulgence to a
degree not only tiresome to his scribe, but even to his auditors;
for as a reward to each of his scribes for concluding his letters
with the words, &ldquo;by divine assistance,&rdquo; he gave
annually a piece of gold, in addition to their stipend.&nbsp;
When on a journey he saw a church or a cross, although in the
midst of conversation either with his inferiors or superiors,
from an excess of devotion, he immediately began to pray, and
when he had finished his prayers, resumed his conversation.&nbsp;
On meeting boys in the way, he invited them by a previous
salutation to salute him, that the blessings of these innocents,
thus extorted, might be returned to him.&nbsp; His wife, Matilda
de Saint Valery, observed all these things: a prudent and chaste
woman; a woman placed with propriety at the head of her house,
equally attentive to the economical disposal of her property
within doors, as to the augmentation of it without; both of whom,
I hope, by their devotion obtained temporal happiness and grace,
as well as the glory of eternity.</p>
<p>It happened also that the hand of a boy, who was endeavouring
to take some young pigeons from a nest, in the church of Saint
David of Llanvaes, <a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a> adhered to the stone on which he
leaned, through the miraculous vengeance, <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>perhaps, of
that saint, in favour of the birds who had taken refuge in his
church; and when the boy, attended by his friends and parents,
had for three successive days and nights offered up his prayers
and supplications before the holy altar of the church, his hand
was, on the third day, liberated by the same divine power which
had so miraculously fastened it.&nbsp; We saw this same boy at
Newbury, in England, now advanced in years, presenting himself
before David the Second, <a name="citation22a"></a><a
href="#footnote22a" class="citation">[22a]</a> bishop of Saint
David&rsquo;s, and certifying to him the truth of this relation,
because it had happened in his diocese.&nbsp; The stone is
preserved in the church to this day among the relics, and the
marks of the five fingers appear impressed on the flint as though
it were in wax.</p>
<p>A small miracle happened at St. Edmundsbury to a poor woman,
who often visited the shrine of the saint, under the mask of
devotion; not with the design of giving, but of taking something
away, namely, the silver and gold offerings, which, by a curious
kind of theft, she licked up by kissing, and carried away in her
mouth.&nbsp; But in one of these attempts her tongue and lips
adhered to the altar, when by divine interposition she was
detected, and openly disgorged the secret theft.&nbsp; Many
persons, both Jews and Christians, expressing their astonishment,
flocked to the place, where for the greater part of the day she
remained motionless, that no possible doubt might be entertained
of the miracle.</p>
<p>In the north of England beyond the Humber, in the church of
Hovedene, <a name="citation22b"></a><a href="#footnote22b"
class="citation">[22b]</a> the concubine of the rector
incautiously sat down on the tomb of St. Osana, sister of king
Osred, <a name="citation22c"></a><a href="#footnote22c"
class="citation">[22c]</a> which projected like a wooden seat; on
wishing to retire, she could not be removed, until the people
came to her assistance; her clothes were rent, her <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>body was laid
bare, and severely afflicted with many strokes of discipline,
even till the blood flowed; nor did she regain her liberty, until
by many tears and sincere repentance she had showed evident signs
of compunction.</p>
<p>What miraculous power hath not in our days been displayed by
the psalter of Quindreda, sister of St. Kenelm, <a
name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a"
class="citation">[23a]</a> by whose instigation he was
killed?&nbsp; On the vigil of the saint, when, according to
custom, great multitudes of women resorted to the feast at
Winchelcumbe, <a name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a> the under butler of that convent
committed fornication with one of them within the precincts of
the monastery.&nbsp; This same man on the following day had the
audacity to carry the psalter in the procession of the relics of
the saints; and on his return to the choir, after the solemnity,
the psalter stuck to his hands.&nbsp; Astonished and greatly
confounded, and at length calling to his mind his crime on the
preceding day, he made confession, and underwent penance; and
being assisted by the prayers of the brotherhood, and having
shown signs of sincere contrition, he was at length liberated
from the miraculous bond.&nbsp; That book was held in great
veneration; because, when the body of St. Kenelm was carried
forth, and the multitude cried out, &ldquo;He is the martyr of
God! truly he is the martyr of God!&rdquo;&nbsp; Quindreda,
conscious and guilty of the murder of her brother, answered,
&ldquo;He is as truly the martyr of God as it is true that my
eyes be on that psalter;&rdquo; for, <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>as she was reading the psalter, both
her eyes were miraculously torn from her head, and fell on the
book, where the marks of the blood yet remain.</p>
<p>Moreover I must not be silent concerning the collar
(<i>torques</i>) which they call St. Canauc&rsquo;s; <a
name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a> for it is most like to gold in weight,
nature, and colour; it is in four pieces wrought round, joined
together artificially, and clefted as it were in the middle, with
a dog&rsquo;s head, the teeth standing outward; it is esteemed by
the inhabitants so powerful a relic, that no man dares swear
falsely when it is laid before him: it bears the marks of some
severe blows, as if made with an iron hammer; for a certain man,
as it is said, endeavouring to break the collar for the sake of
the gold, experienced the divine vengeance, was deprived of his
eyesight, and lingered the remainder of his days in darkness.</p>
<p>A similar circumstance concerning the horn of St. Patrick (not
golden indeed, but of brass [probably bronze], which lately was
brought into these parts from Ireland) excites our
admiration.&nbsp; The miraculous power of this relic first
appeared with a terrible example in that country, through the
foolish and absurd blowing of Bernard, a priest, as is set forth
in our Topography of Ireland.&nbsp; Both the laity and clergy in
Ireland, Scotland, and Wales held in such great veneration
portable bells, and staves crooked at the top, and covered with
gold, silver, or brass, and similar relics of the saints, that
they were much more afraid of swearing falsely by them than by
the gospels; because, from some hidden and miraculous power with
which they are gifted, and the vengeance of the saint to whom
they are particularly pleasing, their despisers and transgressors
are severely punished.&nbsp; The <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>most remarkable circumstance
attending this horn is, that whoever places the wider end of it
to his ear will hear a sweet sound and melody united, such as
ariseth from a harp gently touched.</p>
<p>In our days a strange occurrence happened in the same
district.&nbsp; A wild sow, which by chance had been suckled by a
bitch famous for her nose, became, on growing up, so wonderfully
active in the pursuit of wild animals, that in the faculty of
scent she was greatly superior to dogs, who are assisted by
natural instinct, as well as by human art; an argument that man
(as well as every other animal) contracts the nature of the
female who nurses him.&nbsp; Another prodigious event came to
pass nearly at the same time.&nbsp; A soldier, whose name was
Gilbert Hagernel, after an illness of nearly three years, and the
severe pains as of a woman in labour, in the presence of many
people, voided a calf.&nbsp; A portent of some new and unusual
event, or rather the punishment attendant on some atrocious
crime.&nbsp; It appears also from the ancient and authentic
records of those parts, that during the time St. Elwitus <a
name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a"
class="citation">[25a]</a> led the life of a hermit at
Llanhamelach, <a name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a> the mare that used to carry his
provisions to him was covered by a stag, and produced an animal
of wonderful speed, resembling a horse before and a stag
behind.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Bernard
de Newmarch <a name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a> was the first of the Normans who
acquired by conquest from the Welsh this province, which was
divided into three cantreds. <a name="citation26b"></a><a
href="#footnote26b" class="citation">[26b]</a>&nbsp; He married
the daughter of Nest, daughter of Gruffydd, son of Llewelyn, who,
by his tyranny, for a long time had oppressed Wales; his wife
took her mother&rsquo;s name of Nest, which the English
transmuted into Anne; by whom he had children, one of whom, named
Mahel, a distinguished soldier, was thus unjustly deprived of his
paternal inheritance.&nbsp; His mother, in violation of the
marriage contract, held an adulterous intercourse with a certain
knight; on the discovery of which, the son met the knight
returning in the night from his mother, and having inflicted on
him a severe corporal punishment, and mutilated him, sent him
away with great disgrace.&nbsp; The mother, alarmed at the
confusion which this event caused, and agitated with grief,
breathed nothing but revenge.&nbsp; She therefore went to king
Henry I., and declared with assertions more vindictive than true,
and corroborated by an oath, that her son Mahel was not the son
of Bernard, but of another person with whom she had been secretly
connected.&nbsp; Henry, on account of this oath, or rather
perjury, and swayed more by his inclination than by reason, gave
away her eldest daughter, <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>whom she owned as the legitimate
child of Bernard, in marriage to Milo Fitz-Walter, <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a> constable of Gloucester, with the
honour of Brecheinoc as a portion; and he was afterwards created
earl of Hereford by the empress Matilda, daughter of the said
king.&nbsp; By this wife he had five celebrated warriors; Roger,
Walter, Henry, William, and Mahel; all of whom, by divine
vengeance, or by fatal misfortunes, came to untimely ends; and
yet each of them, except William, succeeded to the paternal
inheritance, but left no issue.&nbsp; Thus this woman (not
deviating from the nature of her sex), in order to satiate her
anger and revenge, with the heavy loss of modesty, and with the
disgrace of infamy, by the same act deprived her son of his
patrimony, and herself of honour.&nbsp; Nor is it wonderful if a
woman follows her innate bad disposition: for it is written in
Ecclesiastes, &ldquo;I have found one good man out of a thousand,
but not one good woman;&rdquo; and in Ecclesiasticus,
&ldquo;There is no head above the head of a serpent; and there is
no wrath above the wrath of a woman;&rdquo; and again,
&ldquo;Small is the wickedness of man compared to the wickedness
of woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the same manner, as we may gather
grapes off thorns, or figs off thistles, Tully, describing the
nature of women, says, &ldquo;Men, perhaps, for the sake of some
advantage will commit one crime; but woman, to gratify one
inclination, will not scruple to perpetrate all sorts of
wickedness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus Juvenal, speaking of women,
say,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash; Nihil est audacior illis<br />
Deprensis, iram atque animos a crimine sumunt.<br />
&mdash; Mulier s&aelig;vissima tunc est<br />
<a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Cum
stimulos animo pudor admovet.<br />
&mdash; colllige, quod vindicta<br />
Nemo magis gaudet quam f&oelig;mina.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But of the five above-mentioned brothers and sons of earl
Milo, the youngest but one, and the last in the inheritance, was
the most remarkable for his inhumanity; he persecuted David II.,
bishop of St. David&rsquo;s, to such a degree, by attacking his
possessions, lands, and vassals, that he was compelled to retire
as an exile from the district of Brecheinoc into England, or to
some other parts of his diocese.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Mahel, being
hospitably entertained by Walter de Clifford, <a
name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a"
class="citation">[28a]</a> in the castle of Brendlais, <a
name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b"
class="citation">[28b]</a> the house was by accident burned down,
and he received a mortal blow by a stone falling from the
principal tower on his head: upon which he instantly dispatched
messengers to recal the bishop, and exclaimed with a lamentable
voice, &ldquo;O, my father and high priest, your saint has taken
most cruel vengeance of me, not waiting the conversion of a
sinner, but hastening his death and overthrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Having often repeated similar expressions, and bitterly lamented
his situation, he thus ended his tyranny and life together; the
first year of his government not having elapsed.</p>
<p>A powerful and noble personage, by name Brachanus, was in
ancient times the ruler of the province of Brecheinoc, and from
him it derived this name.&nbsp; The British histories testify
that he had four-and-twenty daughters, <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>all of whom, dedicated from their
youth to religious observances, happily ended their lives in
sanctity.&nbsp; There are many churches in Wales distinguished by
their names, one of which, situated on the summit of a hill, near
Brecheinoc, and not far from the castle of Aberhodni, is called
the church of St. Almedda, <a name="citation29a"></a><a
href="#footnote29a" class="citation">[29a]</a> after the name of
the holy virgin, who, refusing there the hand of an earthly
spouse, married the Eternal King, and triumphed in a happy
martyrdom; to whose honour a solemn feast is annually held in the
beginning of August, and attended by a large concourse of people
from a considerable distance, when those persons who labour under
various diseases, through the merits of the Blessed Virgin,
received their wished-for health.&nbsp; The circumstances which
occur at every anniversary appear to me remarkable.&nbsp; You may
see men or girls, now in the church, now in the churchyard, now
in the dance, which is led round the churchyard with a song, on a
sudden falling on the ground as in a trance, then jumping up as
in a frenzy, and representing with their hands and feet, before
the people, whatever work they have unlawfully done on feast
days; you may see one man put his hand to the plough, and
another, as it were, goad on the oxen, mitigating their sense of
labour, by the usual rude song: <a name="citation29b"></a><a
href="#footnote29b" class="citation">[29b]</a> <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>one man
imitating the profession of a shoemaker; another, that of a
tanner.&nbsp; Now you may see a girl with a distaff, drawing out
the thread, and winding it again on the spindle; another walking,
and arranging the threads for the web; another, as it were,
throwing the shuttle, and seeming to weave.&nbsp; On being
brought into the church, and led up to the altar with their
oblations, you will be astonished to see them suddenly awakened,
and coming to themselves.&nbsp; Thus, by the divine mercy, which
rejoices in the conversion, not in the death, of sinners, many
persons from the conviction of their senses, are on these feast
days corrected and mended.</p>
<p>This country sufficiently abounds with grain, and if there is
any deficiency, it is amply supplied from the neighbouring parts
of England; it is well stored with pastures, woods, and wild and
domestic animals.&nbsp; River-fish are plentiful, supplied by the
Usk on one side, and by the Wye on the other; each of them
produces salmon and trout; but the Wye abounds most with the
former, the Usk with the latter.&nbsp; The salmon of the Wye are
in season during the winter, those of the Usk in summer; but the
Wye alone produces the fish called umber, <a
name="citation30a"></a><a href="#footnote30a"
class="citation">[30a]</a> the praise of which is celebrated in
the works of Ambrosius, as being found in great numbers in the
rivers near Milan; &ldquo;What,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is more
beautiful to behold, more agreeable to smell, or more pleasant to
taste?&rdquo;&nbsp; The famous lake of Brecheinoc supplies the
courntry with pike, perch, excellent trout, tench, and
eels.&nbsp; A circumstance concerning this lake, which happened a
short time before our days, must not be passed over in
silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the reign of king Henry I., Gruffydd, <a
name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a> son of Rhys <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>ap Tewdwr, held under the king one
comot, namely, the fourth part of the cantred of Caoc, <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a> in the cantref Mawr, which, in title
and dignity, was esteemed by the Welsh equal to the southern part
of Wales, called Deheubarth, that is, the right-hand side of
Wales.&nbsp; When Gruffydd, on his return from the king&rsquo;s
court, passed near this lake, which at that cold season of the
year was covered with water-fowl of various sorts, being
accompanied by Milo, earl of Hereford, and lord of Brecheinoc,
and Payn Fitz-John, lord of Ewyas, who were at that time
secretaries and privy counsellors to the king; earl Milo, wishing
to draw forth from Gruffydd some discourse concerning his innate
nobility, rather jocularly than seriously <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>thus
addressed him: &ldquo;It is an ancient saying in Wales, that if
the natural prince of the country, coming to this lake, shall
order the birds to sing, they will immediately obey
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which Gruffydd, richer in mind than in gold,
(for though his inheritance was diminished, his ambition and
dignity still remained), answered, &ldquo;Do you therefore, who
now hold the dominion of this land, first give the
command;&rdquo; but he and Payn having in vain commanded, and
Gruffydd, perceiving that it was necessary for him to do so in
his turn, dismounted from his horse, and falling on his knees
towards the east, as if he had been about to engage in battle,
prostrate on the ground, with his eyes and hands uplifted to
heaven, poured forth devout prayers to the Lord: at length,
rising up, and signing his face and forehead with the figure of
the cross, he thus openly spake: &ldquo;Almighty God, and Lord
Jesus Christ, who knowest all things, declare here this day thy
power.&nbsp; If thou hast caused me to descend lineally from the
natural princes of Wales, I command these birds in thy name to
declare it;&rdquo; and immediately the birds, beating the water
with their wings, began to cry aloud, and proclaim him.&nbsp; The
spectators were astonished and confounded; and earl Milo hastily
returning with Payn Fitz-John to court, related this singular
occurrence to the king, who is said to have replied, &ldquo;By
the death of Christ (an oath he was accustomed to use), it is not
a matter of so much wonder; for although by our great authority
we commit acts of violence and wrong against these people, yet
they are known to be the rightful inheritors of this
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lake also <a name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a> (according to the testimony of the
inhabitants) <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>is celebrated for its miracles; for, as we have before
observed, it sometimes assumed a greenish hue, so in our days it
has appeared to be tinged with red, not universally, but as if
blood flowed partially through certain veins and small
channels.&nbsp; Moreover it is sometimes seen by the inhabitants
covered and adorned with buildings, pastures, gardens, and
orchards.&nbsp; In the winter, when it is frozen over, and the
surface of the water is converted into a shell of ice, it emits a
horrible sound resembling the moans of many animals collected
together; but this, perhaps, may be occasioned by the sudden
bursting of the shell, and the gradual ebullition of the air
through imperceptible channels.&nbsp; This country is well
sheltered on every side (except the northern) by high mountains;
on the western by those of cantref Bychan; <a
name="citation33a"></a><a href="#footnote33a"
class="citation">[33a]</a> on the southern, by that range, of
which the principal is Cadair Arthur, <a
name="citation33b"></a><a href="#footnote33b"
class="citation">[33b]</a> or the chair of Arthur, so <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>called from
two peaks rising up in the form of a chair, and which, from its
lofty situation, is vulgarly ascribed to Arthur, the most
distinguished king of the Britons.&nbsp; A spring of water rises
on the summit of this mountain, deep, but of a square shape, like
a well, and although no stream runs from it, trout are said to be
sometimes found in it.</p>
<p>Being thus sheltered on the south by high mountains, the
cooler breezes protect this district from the heat of the sun,
and, by their natural salubrity, render the climate most
temperate.&nbsp; Towards the east are the mountains of Talgarth
and Ewyas. <a name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a"
class="citation">[34a]</a>&nbsp; The natives of these parts,
actuated by continual enmities and implacable hatred, are
perpetually engaged in bloody contests.&nbsp; But we leave to
others to describe the great and enormous excesses, which in our
time have been here committed, with regard to marriages,
divorces, and many other circumstances of cruelty and
oppression.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">EWYAS AND LLANTHONI</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the deep vale of Ewyas, <a
name="citation34b"></a><a href="#footnote34b"
class="citation">[34b]</a> which is about an arrow-shot broad,
encircled on all sides by lofty mountains, stands <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>the church of
Saint John the Baptist, covered with lead, and built of wrought
stone; and, considering the nature of the place, not unhandsomely
constructed, on the very spot where the humble chapel of David,
the archbishop, had formerly stood decorated only with moss and
ivy.&nbsp; A situation truly calculated for religion, and more
adapted to canonical discipline, than all the monasteries of the
British isle.&nbsp; It was founded by two hermits, in honour of
the retired life, far removed from the bustle of mankind, in a
solitary vale watered by the river Hodeni.&nbsp; From Hodeni it
was called Lanhodeni, for Lan signifies an ecclesiastical
place.&nbsp; This derivation may appear far-fetched, for the name
of the place, in Welsh, is Nanthodeni.&nbsp; Nant signifies a
running stream, from whence this place is still called by the
inhabitants Landewi Nanthodeni, <a name="citation35"></a><a
href="#footnote35" class="citation">[35]</a> or the church of
Saint David upon the river Hodeni.&nbsp; The English therefore
corruptly call it Lanthoni, whereas it should either be called
Nanthodeni, that is, the brook of the Hodeni, or Lanhodeni, the
church upon the Hodeni.&nbsp; Owing to its mountainous situation,
the rains are frequent, the winds boisterous, <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>and the
clouds in winter almost continual.&nbsp; The air, though heavy,
is healthy; and diseases are so rare, that the brotherhood, when
worn out by long toil and affliction during their residence with
the daughter, retiring to this asylum, and to their
mother&rsquo;s <a name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a> lap, soon regain their long-wished-for
health.&nbsp; For as my Topographical History of Ireland
testifies, in proportion as we proceed to the eastward, the face
of the sky is more pure and subtile, and the air more piercing
and inclement; but as we draw nearer to the westward, the air
becomes more cloudy, but at the same time is more temperate and
healthy.&nbsp; Here the monks, sitting in their cloisters,
enjoying the fresh air, when they happen to look up towards the
horizon, behold the tops of the mountains, as it were, touching
the heavens, and herds of wild deer feeding on their summits: the
body of the sun does not become visible above the heights of the
mountains, even in a clear atmosphere, till about the hour of
prime, or a little before.&nbsp; A place truly fitted for
contemplation, a happy and delightful spot, fully competent, from
its first establishment, to supply all its own wants, had not the
extravagance of English luxury, the pride of a sumptuous table,
the increasing growth of intemperance and ingratitude, added to
the negligence of its patrons and prelates, reduced it from
freedom to servility; and if the step-daughter, no less enviously
than odiously, had not supplanted her mother.</p>
<p>It seems worthy of remark, that all the priors who were
hostile to this establishment, died by divine visitation.&nbsp;
William, <a name="citation36b"></a><a href="#footnote36b"
class="citation">[36b]</a> who first despoiled the place of its
herds and storehouses, being deposed by the fraternity, forfeited
his right of sepulture amongst the priors.&nbsp; Clement <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>seemed to
like this place of study and prayer, yet, after the example of
Heli the priest, as he neither reproved nor restrained his
brethren from plunder and other offences, he died by a paralytic
stroke.&nbsp; And Roger, who was more an enemy to this place than
either of his predecessors, and openly carried away every thing
which they had left behind, wholly robbing the church of its
books, ornaments, and privileges, was also struck with a
paralytic affection long before his death, resigned his honours,
and lingered out the remainder of his days in sickness.</p>
<p>In the reign of king Henry I., when the mother church was as
celebrated for her affluence as for her sanctity (two qualities
which are seldom found thus united), the daughter not yet being
in existence (and I sincerely wish she never had been produced),
the fame of so much religion attracted hither Roger, bishop of
Salisbury, who was at that time prime minister; for it is virtue
to love virtue, even in another man, and a great proof of innate
goodness to show a detestation of those vices which hitherto have
not been avoided.&nbsp; When he had reflected with admiration on
the nature of the place, the solitary life of the fraternity,
living in canonical obedience, and serving God without a murmur
or complaint, he returned to the king, and related to him what he
thought most worthy of remark; and after spending the greater
part of the day in the praises of this place, he finished his
panegyric with these words: &ldquo;Why should I say more? the
whole treasure of the king and his kingdom would not be
sufficient to build such a cloister.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having held the
minds of the king and the court for a long time in suspense by
this assertion, he at length explained the enigma, by saying that
he alluded to the cloister of mountains, by which this church is
on every side surrounded.&nbsp; But William, a knight, who first
discovered this place, and his companion Ervistus, a priest,
having heard, perhaps, as it is written in the Fathers, according
to the opinion of Jerome, &ldquo;that the church of Christ <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>decreased in
virtues as it increased in riches,&rdquo; were accustomed often
devoutly to solicit the Lord that this place might never attain
great possessions.&nbsp; They were exceedingly concerned when
this religious foundation began to be enriched by its first lord
and patron, Hugh de Lacy, <a name="citation38"></a><a
href="#footnote38" class="citation">[38]</a> and by the lands and
ecclesiastical benefices conferred upon it by the bounty of
others of the faithful: from their predilection to poverty, they
rejected many offers of manors and churches; and being situated
in a wild spot, they would not suffer the thick and wooded parts
of the valley to be cultivated and levelled, lest they should be
tempted to recede from their heremitical mode of life.</p>
<p>But whilst the establishment of the mother church increased
daily in riches and endowments, availing herself of the hostile
state of the country, a rival daughter sprang up at Gloucester,
under the protection of Milo, earl of Hereford; as if by divine
providence, and through the merits of the saints and prayers of
those holy men (of whom two lie buried before the high altar), it
were destined that the daughter church should be founded in
superfluities, whilst the mother continued in that laudable state
of mediocrity which she had always affected and coveted.&nbsp;
Let the active therefore reside there, the contemplative here;
there the pursuit of terrestrial riches, here the love of
celestial delights; there let them enjoy the concourse of men,
here the presence of angels; there let the powerful of this world
be entertained, here let the poor of Christ be relieved; there, I
say, let human actions and declamations be heard, but here let
reading and prayers be heard only in whispers; there let
opulence, <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>the parent and nurse of vice, increase with cares, here
let the virtuous and golden mean be all-sufficient.&nbsp; In both
places the canonical discipline instituted by Augustine, which is
now distinguished above all other orders, is observed; for the
Benedictines, when their wealth was increased by the fervour of
charity, and multiplied by the bounty of the faithful, under the
pretext of a bad dispensation, corrupted by gluttony and
indulgence an order which in its original state of poverty was
held in high estimation.&nbsp; The Cistercian order, derived from
the former, at first deserved praise and commendation from its
adhering voluntarily to the original vows of poverty and
sanctity: until ambition, the blind mother of mischief, unable to
fix bounds to prosperity, was introduced; for as Seneca says,
&ldquo;Too great happiness makes men greedy, nor are their
desires ever so temperate, as to terminate in what is
acquired:&rdquo; a step is made from great things to greater, and
men having attained what they did not expect, form the most
unbounded hopes; to which the poet Ovid thus alludes.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Luxuriant animi rebus plerumque
secundis,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nec facile est &aelig;qua commoda mente
pati;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Creverunt opes et opum furiosa cupido,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Et cum possideant plurima, plura petunt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also the poet Horace:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;scilicet improb&aelig;<br />
Crescunt diviti&aelig;, tamen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Curt&aelig; nescio quid semper abest rei.<br />
Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Majorumque fames.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which purpose the poet Lucan says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;O vit&aelig; tuta facultas<br />
Pauperis, angustique lares, o munera nondum<br />
Intellecta De&ucirc;m!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>And
Petronius:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Non bibit inter aquas nec poma fugacia
carpit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tantalus infelix, quem sua vota premunt.<br />
Divitis hic magni facies erit, omnia late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Qui tenet, et sicco concoquit ore famem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mountains are full of herds and horses, the woods well
stored with swine and goats, the pastures with sheep, the plains
with cattle, the arable fields with ploughs; and although these
things in very deed are in great abundance, yet each of them,
from the insatiable nature of the mind, seems too narrow and
scanty.&nbsp; Therefore lands are seized, landmarks removed,
boundaries invaded, and the markets in consequence abound with
merchandise, the courts of justice with law-suits, and the senate
with complaints.&nbsp; Concerning such things, we read in Isaiah,
&ldquo;Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to
field, till there be no place, that they be placed alone in the
midst of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If therefore, the prophet inveighs so much against those who
proceed to the boundaries, what would he say to those who go far
beyond them?&nbsp; From these and other causes, the true colour
of religion was so converted into the dye of falsehood, that
manners internally black assumed a fair exterior:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Qui color albus erat, nunc est contrarius
albo.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that the scripture seems to be fulfilled concerning these
men, &ldquo;Beware of false prophets, who come to you in
sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous
wolves.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I am inclined to think this avidity does
not proceed from any bad intention.&nbsp; For the monks of this
Order (although themselves most abstemious) incessantly exercise,
more than any others, the acts of charity and beneficence towards
the poor and strangers; and because they do not live as others
upon fixed incomes, but depend only on their labour and
forethought for subsistence, they are anxious to obtain lands,
farms, <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>and
pastures, which may enable them to perform these acts of
hospitality.&nbsp; However, to repress and remove from this
sacred Order the detestable stigma of ambition, I wish they would
sometimes call to mind what is written in Ecclesiasticus,
&ldquo;Whoso bringeth an offering of the goods of the poor, doth
as one that killeth the son before his father&rsquo;s
eyes;&rdquo; and also the sentiment of Gregory, &ldquo;A good use
does not justify things badly acquired;&rdquo; and also that of
Ambrose, &ldquo;He who wrongfully receives, that he may well
dispense, is rather burthened than assisted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such
men seem to say with the Apostle, &ldquo;Let us do evil that good
may come.&rdquo;&nbsp; For it is written, &ldquo;Mercy ought to
be of such a nature as may be received, not rejected, which may
purge away sins, not make a man guilty before the Lord, arising
from your own just labours, not those of other men.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Hear what Solomon says; &ldquo;Honour the Lord from your just
labours.&rdquo;&nbsp; What shall they say who have seized upon
other men&rsquo;s possessions, and exercised charity?&nbsp;
&ldquo;O Lord! in thy name we have done charitable deeds, we have
fed the poor, clothed the naked, and hospitably received the
stranger:&rdquo; to whom the Lord will answer; &ldquo;Ye speak of
what ye have given away, but speak not of the rapine ye have
committed; ye relate concerning those ye have fed, and remember
not those ye have killed.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have judged it proper to
insert in this place an instance of an answer which Richard, king
of the English, made to Fulke, <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a> a good and holy man,
by whom <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>God in these our days has wrought many signs in the
kingdom of France.&nbsp; This man had among other things said to
the king; &ldquo;You have three daughters, namely, Pride, Luxury,
and Avarice; and as long as they shall remain with you, you can
never expect to be in favour with God.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which the
king, after a short pause, replied: &ldquo;I have already given
away those daughters in marriage: Pride to the Templars, Luxury
to the Black Monks, and Avarice to the White.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
a remarkable circumstance, or rather a miracle, concerning
Lanthoni, that, although it is on every side surrounded by lofty
mountains, not stony or rocky, but of a soft nature, and covered
with grass, Parian stones are frequently found there, and are
called free-stones, from the facility with which they admit of
being cut and polished; and with these the church is beautifully
built.&nbsp; It is also wonderful, that when, after a diligent
search, all the stones have been removed from the mountains, and
no more can be found, upon another search, a few days afterwards,
they reappear in greater quantities to those who seek them.&nbsp;
With respect to the two Orders, the Cluniac and the Cistercian,
this may be relied upon; although the latter are possessed of
fine buildings, with ample revenues and estates, they will soon
be reduced to poverty and destruction.&nbsp; To the former, on
the contrary, you would allot a barren desert and a solitary
wood; yet in a few years you will find them in possession of
sumptuous churches and houses, and encircled with an extensive
property.&nbsp; The difference of manners (as it appears to me)
causes this contrast.&nbsp; For as without meaning offence to
either party, I shall speak the truth, the one feels the benefits
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>of
sobriety, parsimony, and prudence, whilst the other suffers from
the bad effects of gluttony and intemperance: the one, like bees,
collect their stores into a heap, and unanimously agree in the
disposal of one well-regulated purse; the others pillage and
divert to improper uses the largesses which have been collected
by divine assistance, and by the bounties of the faithful; and
whilst each individual consults solely his own interest, the
welfare of the community suffers; since, as Sallust observes,
&ldquo;Small things increase by concord, and the greatest are
wasted by discord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Besides, sooner than lessen the
number of one of the thirteen or fourteen dishes which they claim
by right of custom, or even in a time of scarcity or famine
recede in the smallest degree from their accustomed good fare,
they would suffer the richest lands and the best buildings of the
monastery to become a prey to usury, and the numerous poor to
perish before their gates.</p>
<p>The first of these Orders, at a time when there was a
deficiency in grain, with a laudable charity, not only gave away
their flocks and herds, but resigned to the poor one of the two
dishes with which they were always contented.&nbsp; But in these
our days, in order to remove this stain, it is ordained by the
Cistercians, &ldquo;That in future neither farms nor pastures
shall be purchased; and that they shall be satisfied with those
alone which have been freely and unconditionally bestowed upon
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Order, therefore, being satisfied more
than any other with humble mediocrity, and, if not wholly, yet in
a great degree checking their ambition; and though placed in a
worldly situation, yet avoiding, as much as possible, its
contagion; neither notorious for gluttony or drunkenness, for
luxury or lust; is fearful and ashamed of incurring public
scandal, as will be more fully explained in the book we mean (by
the grace of God) to write concerning the ecclesiastical
Orders.</p>
<p>In these temperate regions I have obtained (according to the
usual expression) a place of dignity, but no great <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>omen of
future pomp or riches; and possessing a small residence <a
name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a> near the castle of Brecheinoc, well
adapted to literary pursuits, and to the contemplation of
eternity, I envy not the riches of Croesus; happy and contented
with that mediocrity, which I prize far beyond all the perishable
and transitory things of this world.&nbsp; But let us return to
our subject.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE JOURNEY BY COED GRONO AND
ABERGEVENNI</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> thence <a
name="citation44b"></a><a href="#footnote44b"
class="citation">[44b]</a> we proceeded through the narrow, woody
tract called the bad pass of Coed Grono, leaving the <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>noble
monastery of Lanthoni, inclosed by its mountains, on our
left.&nbsp; The castle of Abergevenni is so called from its
situation at the confluence of the river Gevenni with the
Usk.</p>
<p>It happened a short time after the death of king Henry I.,
that Richard de Clare, a nobleman of high birth, and lord of
Cardiganshire, passed this way on his journey from England into
Wales, accompanied by Brian de Wallingford, lord of this
province, and many men-at-arms.&nbsp; At the passage of Coed
Grono, <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a> and at the entrance into the wood, he
dismissed him and his attendants, though much against their will,
and proceeded on his journey unarmed; from too great a
presumption of security, preceded only by a minstrel and a
singer, one accompanying the other on the fiddle.&nbsp; The Welsh
awaiting his arrival, with Iorwerth, brother of Morgan of
Caerleon, at their head, and others of his family, rushed upon
him unawares from the thickets, and killed him and many of his
followers.&nbsp; Thus it appears how incautious and neglectful of
itself is too great presumption; for fear teaches foresight and
caution in prosperity, but audacity is precipitate, and
inconsiderate rashness will not await the advice of the
leader.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>A
sermon having been delivered at Abergevenni, <a
name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46"
class="citation">[46]</a> and many persons converted to the
cross, a certain nobleman of those parts, named Arthenus, came to
the archbishop, who was proceeding towards the castle of Usk, and
humbly begged pardon for having neglected to meet him
sooner.&nbsp; Being questioned whether he would take the cross,
he replied, &ldquo;That ought not be done without the advice of
his friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; The archbishop then asked him,
&ldquo;Are you not going to consult your wife?&rdquo;&nbsp; To
which he modestly answered, with a downcast look, &ldquo;When the
work of a man is to be undertaken, the counsel of a woman ought
not to be asked;&rdquo; and instantly received the cross from the
archbishop.</p>
<p>We leave to others the relation of those frequent and cruel
excesses which in our times have arisen amongst the inhabitants
of these parts, against the governors of castles, and the
vindictive retaliations of the governors against the
natives.&nbsp; But king Henry II. was the true author, and Ranulf
Poer, sheriff of Hereford, the instrument, of the enormous
cruelties and slaughter perpetrated here in our days, which I
thought better to omit, <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>lest bad men should be induced to
follow the example; for although temporary advantage may seem to
arise from a base cause, yet, by the balance of a righteous
judge, the punishment of wickedness may be deferred, though not
totally avoided, according to the words of the poet,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Non habet eventus sordida pr&aelig;da
bonos.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For after seven years of peace and tranquillity, the sons and
grandsons of the deceased, having attained the age of manhood,
took advantage of the absence of the lord of the castle
(Abergevenni), and, burning with revenge, concealed themselves,
with no inconsiderable force during the night, within the woody
foss of the castle.&nbsp; One of them, name Sisillus (Sitsylt)
son of Eudaf, on the preceding day said rather jocularly to the
constable, &ldquo;Here will we enter this night,&rdquo; pointing
out to him a certain angle in the wall where it seemed the
lowest; but since</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;Ridendo dicere verum<br />
Quis vetat?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;fas est et ab hoste
doceri,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the constable and his household watched all night under arms,
till at length, worn out by fatigue, they all retired to rest on
the appearance of daylight, upon which the enemy attacked the
walls with scaling-ladders, at the very place that had been
pointed out.&nbsp; The constable and his wife were taken
prisoners, with many others, a few persons only escaping, who had
sheltered themselves in the principal tower.&nbsp; With the
exception of this stronghold, the enemy violently seized and
burned everything; and thus, by the righteous judgment of God,
the crime was punished in the very place where it had been
committed.&nbsp; A short time after the taking of this fortress,
when the aforesaid sheriff was building a castle <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>at
Landinegat, <a name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a> near Monmouth, with the assistance of
the army he had brought from Hereford, he was attacked at break
of day, when</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tythoni croceum linquens Aurora
cubile&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was only beginning to divest herself of the shades of night,
by the young men from Gwent and the adjacent parts, with the
descendants of those who had been slain.&nbsp; Through aware of
this premeditated attack, and prepared and drawn up in battle
array, they were nevertheless repulsed within their
intrenchments, and the sheriff, together with nine of the chief
men of Hereford, and many others, were pierced to death with
lances.&nbsp; It is remarkable that, although Ranulf, besides
many other mortal wounds, had the veins and arteries of his neck
and his windpipe separated with a sword, he made signs for a
priest, and from the merit of his past life, and the honour and
veneration he had shewn to those chosen into the sacred order of
Christ, he was confessed, and received extreme unction before he
died.&nbsp; And, indeed, many events concur to prove that, as
those who respect the priesthood, in their latter days enjoy the
satisfaction of friendly intercourse, so do their revilers and
accusers often die without that consolation.&nbsp; William de
Braose, who was not the author of the crime we have preferred
passing over in silence, but the executioner, or, rather, not the
preventer of its execution, while the murderous bands were
fulfilling the orders they had received, was precipitated into a
deep foss, and being taken by the enemy, was drawn forth, and
only by a sudden effort of his own troops, and by divine mercy,
escaped uninjured.&nbsp; Hence it is evident that he who offends
in a less degree, and unwillingly permits a thing to be done, is
more mildly punished than he who adds counsel and authority to
his act.&nbsp; Thus, in the sufferings of Christ, Judas was <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>punished with
hanging, the Jews with destruction and banishment, and Pilate
with exile.&nbsp; But the end of the king, who assented to and
ordered this treachery, sufficiently manifested in what manner,
on account of this and many other enormities he had committed (as
in the book &ldquo;De Instructione Principis,&rdquo; by
God&rsquo;s guidance, we shall set forth), he began with
accumulated ignominy, sorrow, and confusion, to suffer punishment
in this world. <a name="citation49a"></a><a href="#footnote49a"
class="citation">[49a]</a></p>
<p>It seems worthy of remark, that the people of what is called
Venta <a name="citation49b"></a><a href="#footnote49b"
class="citation">[49b]</a> are more accustomed to war, more
famous for valour, and more expert in archery, than those of any
other part of Wales.&nbsp; The following examples prove the truth
of this assertion.&nbsp; In the last capture of the aforesaid
castle, which happened in our days, two soldiers passing over a
bridge to take refuge in a tower built on a mound of earth, the
Welsh, taking them in the rear, penetrated with their arrows the
oaken portal of the tower, which was four fingers thick; in
memory of which circumstance, the arrows were preserved in the
gate.&nbsp; William de Braose also testifies that one of his
soldiers, in a conflict with the Welsh, was wounded by an arrow,
which passed through his thigh and the armour with which it was
cased on both sides, and, through that part of the saddle which
is called the <i>alva</i>, mortally wounded the horse.&nbsp;
Another soldier had his hip, equally sheathed in armour,
penetrated by an arrow quite to the saddle, and on turning his
horse round, received a similar wound on the opposite hip, which
fixed him on both sides of his seat.&nbsp; What more could be
expected from a balista?&nbsp; Yet the bows used by this people
are not made of horn, <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>ivory, or yew, but of wild elm;
unpolished, rude, and uncouth, but stout; not calculated to shoot
an arrow to a great distance, but to inflict very severe wounds
in close fight.</p>
<p>But let us again return to our Itinerary.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE PROGRESS BY THE CASTLE OF USK AND
THE TOWN OF CAERLEON</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the castle of Usk, a multitude
of persons influenced by the archbishop&rsquo;s sermon, and by
the exhortations of the good and worthy William bishop of Landaf,
<a name="citation50a"></a><a href="#footnote50a"
class="citation">[50a]</a> who faithfully accompanied us through
his diocese, were signed with the cross; Alexander archdeacon of
Bangor <a name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b"
class="citation">[50b]</a> acting as interpreter to the
Welsh.&nbsp; It is remarkable that many of the most notorious
murderers, thieves, and robbers of the neighbourhood were here
converted, to the astonishment of the spectators.&nbsp; Passing
from thence through Caerleon and leaving far on our left hand the
castle of Monmouth, and the noble forest of Dean, situated on the
other side of the Wye and on this side the Severn, and which
amply supplies Gloucester with iron and venison, we spent the
night at Newport, having crossed the river Usk three times. <a
name="citation50c"></a><a href="#footnote50c"
class="citation">[50c]</a>&nbsp; Caerleon means the city of
Legions, Caer, in the British language, signifying a city or
camp, for there the Roman legions, sent into this island, were
accustomed to winter, and from this circumstance it was styled
the city of legions.&nbsp; This city was of undoubted <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>antiquity,
and handsomely built of masonry, with courses of bricks, by the
Romans.&nbsp; Many vestiges of its former splendour may yet be
seen; immense palaces, formerly ornamented with gilded roofs, in
imitation of Roman magnificence, inasmuch as they were first
raised by the Roman princes, and embellished with splendid
buildings; a tower of prodigious size, remarkable hot baths,
relics of temples, and theatres, all inclosed within fine walls,
parts of which remain standing.&nbsp; You will find on all sides,
both within and without the circuit of the walls, subterraneous
buildings, aqueducts, underground passages; and what I think
worthy of notice, stoves contrived with wonderful art, to
transmit the heat insensibly through narrow tubes passing up the
side walls.</p>
<p>Julius and Aaron, after suffering martyrdom, were buried in
this city, and had each a church dedicated to him.&nbsp; After
Albanus and Amphibalus, they were esteemed the chief protomartyrs
of Britannia Major.&nbsp; In ancient times there were three fine
churches in this city: one dedicated to Julius the martyr, graced
with a choir of nuns; another to Aaron, his associate, and
ennobled with an order of canons; and the third distinguished as
the metropolitan of Wales.&nbsp; Amphibalus, the instructor of
Albanus in the true faith, was born in this place.&nbsp; This
city is well situated on the river Usk, navigable to the sea, and
adorned with woods and meadows.&nbsp; The Roman ambassadors here
received their audience at the court of the great king Arthur;
and here also, the archbishop Dubricius ceded his honours to
David of Menevia, the metropolitan see being translated from this
place to Menevia, according to the prophecy of Merlin
Ambrosius.&nbsp; &ldquo;Menevia pallio urbis Legionum
induetur.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Menevia shall be invested with the
pall of the city of Legions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not far hence is a rocky eminence, impending over the Severn,
called by the English Gouldcliffe <a name="citation51"></a><a
href="#footnote51" class="citation">[51]</a> or golden rock, <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>because from
the reflections of the sun&rsquo;s rays it assumes a bright
golden colour:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nec mihi de facili fieri persuasio
posset,<br />
Quod frustra tantum dederit natura nito rem<br />
Saxis, quodque suo fuerit flos hic sine fructu.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor can I be easily persuaded that nature hath given such
splendour to the rocks in vain, and that this flower should be
without fruit, if any one would take the pains to penetrate
deeply into the bowels of the earth; if any one, I say, would
extract honey from the rock, and oil from the stone.&nbsp; Indeed
many riches of nature lie concealed through inattention, which
the diligence of posterity will bring to light; for, as necessity
first taught the ancients to discover the conveniences of life,
so industry, and a greater acuteness of intellect, have laid open
many things to the moderns; as the poet says, assigning two
causes for these discoveries,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;labor omnia vincit<br />
Improbus, et duris urgens in rebus egestas.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worthy of observation, that there lived in the
neighbourhood of this City of Legions, in our time, a Welshman
named Melerius, who, under the following circumstances, acquired
the knowledge of future and occult events.&nbsp; Having, on a
certain night, namely that of Palm Sunday, met a damsel whom he
had long loved, in a pleasant and convenient place, while he was
indulging in her embraces, suddenly, instead of a beautiful girl,
he found in his arms a hairy, rough, and hideous creature, the
sight of which deprived him of his senses, and he became
mad.&nbsp; After remaining many years in this condition, he was
restored to health in the church of St. David&rsquo;s, through
the merits of its saints.&nbsp; But having always an
extraordinary familiarity with unclean spirits, <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>by seeing
them, knowing them, talking with them, and calling each by his
proper name, he was enabled, through their assistance, to foretel
future events.&nbsp; He was, indeed, often deceived (as they are)
with respect to circumstances at a great distance of time or
place, but was less mistaken in affairs which were likely to
happen nearer, or within the space of a year.&nbsp; The spirits
appeared to him, usually on foot, equipped as hunters, with horns
suspended from their necks, and truly as hunters, not of animals,
but of souls.&nbsp; He particularly met them near monasteries and
monastic cells; for where rebellion exists, there is the greatest
need of armies and strength.&nbsp; He knew when any one spoke
falsely in his presence, for he saw the devil, as it were,
leaping and exulting upon the tongue of the liar.&nbsp; If he
looked on a book faultily or falsely written, or containing a
false passage, although wholly illiterate, he would point out the
place with his finger.&nbsp; Being questioned how he could gain
such knowledge, he said that he was directed by the demon&rsquo;s
finger to the place.&nbsp; In the same manner, entering into the
dormitory of a monastery, he indicated the bed of any monk not
sincerely devoted to religion.&nbsp; He said, that the spirit of
gluttony and surfeit was in every respect sordid; but that the
spirit of luxury and lust was more beautiful than others in
appearance, though in fact most foul.&nbsp; If the evil spirits
oppressed him too much, the Gospel of St. John was placed on his
bosom, when, like birds, they immediately vanished; but when that
book was removed, and the History of the Britons, by Geoffrey
Arthur, <a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a> was substituted in its place, they
instantly reappeared in greater numbers, and remained a longer
time than usual on his body and on the book.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that Barnabas placed the Gospel of St.
Matthew upon sick persons, and they were healed; from which, as
well as from the foregoing circumstance, it appears how great a
dignity and reverence is due to the sacred books of the gospel,
and with what danger and <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>risk of damnation every one who
swears falsely by them, deviates from the paths of truth.&nbsp;
The fall of Enoch, abbot of Strata Marcella, <a
name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54"
class="citation">[54]</a> too well known in Wales, was revealed
to many the day after it happened, by Melerius, who, being asked
how he knew this circumstance, said, that a demon came to him
disguised as a hunter, and, exulting in the prospect of such a
victory, foretold the ruin of the abbot, and explained in what
manner he would make him run away with a nun from the
monastery.&nbsp; The end in view was probably the humiliation and
correction of the abbot, as was proved from his shortly returning
home so humbled and amended, that he scarcely could be said to
have erred.&nbsp; Seneca says, &ldquo;He falls not badly, who
rises stronger from his fall.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter was more
strenuous after his denial of Christ, and Paul after being
stoned; since, where sin abounds, there will grace also
superabound.&nbsp; Mary Magdalen was strengthened after her
frailty.&nbsp; He secretly revealed to Canon, the good and
religious abbot of Alba-domus, his opinion of a certain woman
whom he had seen; upon which the holy man confessed, with tears
in his eyes, his predilection for her, and received from three
priests the discipline of incontinence.&nbsp; For as that long
and experienced subtle enemy, by arguing from certain conjectural
signs, may foretell future by past events, so by insidious
treachery and contrivance, added to exterior appearances, he may
sometimes be able to discover the interior workings of the
mind.</p>
<p>At the same time there was in Lower Gwent a demon <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>incubus, who,
from his love for a certain young woman, and frequenting the
place where she lived, often conversed with men, and frequently
discovered hidden things and future events.&nbsp; Melerius being
interrogated concerning him, said he knew him well, and mentioned
his name.&nbsp; He affirmed that unclean spirits conversed with
mankind before war, or any great internal disturbance, which was
shortly afterwards proved, by the destruction of the province by
Howel, son of Iorwerth of Caerleon.&nbsp; At the same time, when
king Henry II., having taken the king of Scotland prisoner, had
restored peace to his kingdom, Howel, fearful of the royal
revenge for the war he had waged, was relieved from his
difficulties by these comfortable words of Melerius: &ldquo;Fear
not,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;Howel, the wrath of the king, since
he must go into other parts.&nbsp; An important city which he
possesses beyond sea is now besieged by the king of France, on
which account he will postpone every other business, and hasten
thither with all possible expedition.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three days
afterwards, Howel received advice that this event had really come
to pass, owing to the siege of the city of Rouen.&nbsp; He
forewarned also Howel of the betraying of his castle at Usk, a
long time before it happened, and informed him that he should be
wounded, but not mortally; and that he should escape alive from
the town.&nbsp; In this alone he was deceived, for he soon after
died of the same wound.&nbsp; Thus does that archenemy favour his
friends for a time, and thus does he at last reward them.</p>
<p>In all these singular events it appears to me most wonderful
that he saw those spirits so plainly with his carnal eyes,
because spirits cannot be discerned by the eyes of mortals,
unless they assume a corporeal substance; but if in order to be
seen they had assumed such a substance, how could they remain
unperceived by other persons who were present?&nbsp; Perhaps they
were seen by such a miraculous vision as when king Balthazar saw
the hand of one writing on the wall, &ldquo;Mane, Techel,
Phares,&rdquo; <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>that is, weighed, numbered, divided; who in the same
night lost both his kingdom and his life.&nbsp; But Cambria well
knows how in these districts, from a blind desire of dominion, a
total dissolution of the endearing ties of consanguinity, and a
bad and depraved example diffused throughout the country, good
faith has been so shamefully perverted and abused.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">NEWPORT AND CAERDYF</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Newport, where the river Usk,
descending from its original source in Cantref Bachan, falls into
the sea, many persons were induced to take the cross.&nbsp;
Having passed the river Remni, we approached the noble castle of
Caerdyf, <a name="citation56a"></a><a href="#footnote56a"
class="citation">[56a]</a> situated on the banks of the river
Taf.&nbsp; In the neighbourhood of Newport, which is in the
district of Gwentluc, <a name="citation56b"></a><a
href="#footnote56b" class="citation">[56b]</a> there is a small
stream called Nant Pencarn, <a name="citation56c"></a><a
href="#footnote56c" class="citation">[56c]</a> passable only at
certain fords, not so much owing to the depth of its waters, as
from the hollowness of its channel and muddy bottom.&nbsp; The
public road led formerly to a ford, called Ryd Pencarn, that is,
the ford <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>under the head of a rock, from Rhyd, which in the
British language signifies a ford, Pen, the head, and Cam, a
rock; of which place Merlin Sylvester had thus prophesied:
&ldquo;Whenever you shall see a mighty prince with a freckled
face make an hostile irruption into the southern part of Britain,
should he cross the ford of Pencarn, then know ye, that the force
of Cambria shall be brought low.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now it came to pass
in our times, that king Henry II. took up arms against Rhys, the
son of Gruffydd, and directed his march through the southern part
of Wales towards Caermardyn.&nbsp; On the day he intended to pass
over Nant Pentcarn, the old Britons of the neighbourhood watched
his approach towards the ford with the utmost solicitude;
knowing, since he was both mighty and freckled, that if the
passage of the destined ford was accomplished, the prophecy
concerning him would undoubtedly be fulfilled.&nbsp; When the
king had followed the road leading to a more modern ford of the
river (the old one spoken of in the prophecy having been for a
long time in disuse), and was preparing to pass over, the pipers
and trumpeters, called Cornhiriet, from <i>hir</i>, long, and
<i>cornu</i>, a horn, began to sound their instruments on the
opposite bank, in honour of the king.&nbsp; The king&rsquo;s
horse, startling at the wild, unusual noise, refused to obey the
spur, and enter the water; upon which, the king, gathering up the
reins, hastened, in violent wrath, to the ancient ford, which he
rapidly passed; and the Britons returned to their homes, alarmed
and dismayed at the destruction which seemed to await them.&nbsp;
An extraordinary circumstance occurred likewise at the castle of
Caerdyf.&nbsp; William earl of Gloucester, son of earl Robert, <a
name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a> who, besides that castle, <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>possessed by
hereditary right all the province of Gwladvorgan, <a
name="citation58a"></a><a href="#footnote58a"
class="citation">[58a]</a> that is, the land of Morgan, had a
dispute with one of his dependants, whose name was Ivor the
Little, being a man of short stature, but of great courage.&nbsp;
This man was, after the manner of the Welsh, owner of a tract of
mountainous and woody country, of the whole, or a part of which,
the earl endeavoured to deprive him.&nbsp; At that time the
castle of Caerdyf was surrounded with high walls, guarded by one
hundred and twenty men-at-arms, a numerous body of archers, and a
strong watch.&nbsp; The city also contained many stipendiary
soldiers; yet, in defiance of all these precautions of security,
Ivor, in the dead of night, secretly scaled the walls, and,
seizing the count and countess, with their only son, carried them
off into the woods, and did not release them until he had
recovered everything that had been unjustly taken from him, and
received a compensation of additional property; for, as the poet
observes,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Spectandum est semper ne magna injuria
fiat<br />
Fortibus et miseris; tollas licet omne quod usquam est<br />
Argenti atque auri, spoliatis arma supersunt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this same town of Caerdyf, king Henry II., on his return
from Ireland, the first Sunday after Easter, passed the
night.&nbsp; In the morning, having heard mass, he remained at
his devotions till every one had quitted the chapel of St.
Piranus. <a name="citation58b"></a><a href="#footnote58b"
class="citation">[58b]</a>&nbsp; As he mounted his horse at the
<a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>door, a
man of a fair complexion, with a round tonsure and meagre
countenance, tall, and about forty years of age, habited in a
white robe falling down to his naked feet, thus addressed him in
the Teutonic tongue: &ldquo;God hold the, cuing,&rdquo; which
signifies, &ldquo;May God protect you, king;&rdquo; and
proceeded, in the same language, &ldquo;Christ and his Holy
Mother, John the Baptist, and the Apostle Peter salute thee, and
command thee strictly to prohibit throughout thy whole dominions
every kind of buying or selling on Sundays, and not to suffer any
work to be done on those days, except such as relates to the
preparation of daily food; that due attention may be paid to the
performance of the divine offices.&nbsp; If thou dost this, all
thy undertakings shall be successful, and thou shalt lead a happy
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; The king, in French, desired Philip de
Mercros, <a name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59"
class="citation">[59]</a> who held the reins of his horse, to ask
the rustic if he had dreamt this? and when the soldier explained
to him the king&rsquo;s question in English, he replied in the
same language he had before used, &ldquo;Whether I have dreamt it
or not, observe what day this is (addressing himself to the king,
not to the interpreter), and unless thou shalt do so, and quickly
amend thy life, before the expiration of one year, thou shalt
hear such things concerning what thou lovest best in this world,
and shalt thereby be so much troubled, that thy disquietude shall
continue to thy life&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;&nbsp; The king, spurring
his horse, proceeded a little way towards the gate, when,
stopping suddenly, he ordered his attendants to call the good man
back.&nbsp; The soldier, and a young man named William, the only
persons who remained <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>with the king, accordingly called
him, and sought him in vain in the chapel, and in all the inns of
the city.&nbsp; The king, vexed that he had not spoken more to
him, waited alone a long time, while other persons went in search
of him; and when he could not be found, pursued his journey over
the bridge of Remni to Newport.&nbsp; The fatal prediction came
to pass within the year, as the man had threatened; for the
king&rsquo;s three sons, Henry, the eldest, and his brothers,
Richard of Poitou, and Geoffrey, count of Britany, in the
following Lent, deserted to Louis king of France, which caused
the king greater uneasiness than he had ever before experienced;
and which, by the conduct of some one of his sons, was continued
till the time of his decease.&nbsp; This monarch, through divine
mercy (for God is more desirous of the conversion than the
destruction of a sinner), received many other admonitions and
reproofs about this time, and shortly before his death; all of
which, being utterly incorrigible, he obstinately and obdurately
despised, as will be more fully set forth (by the favour of God)
in my book, &ldquo;de Principis Instructione.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not far from Caerdyf is a small island situated near the shore
of the Severn, called Barri, from St. Baroc <a
name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a> who formerly lived there, and whose
remains are deposited in a chapel overgrown with ivy, having been
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>transferred to a coffin.&nbsp; From hence a noble
family, of the maritime parts of South Wales, who owned this
island and the adjoining estates, received the name of de
Barri.&nbsp; It is remarkable that, in a rock near the entrance
of the island, there is a small cavity, to which, if the ear is
applied, a noise is heard like that of smiths at work, the
blowing of bellows, strokes of hammers, grinding of tools, and
roaring of furnaces; and it might easily be imagined that such
noises, which are continued at the ebb and flow of the tides,
were occasioned by the influx of the sea under the cavities of
the rocks.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE SEE OF LANDAF AND MONASTERY OF MARGAN,
AND THE REMARKABLE THINGS IN THOSE PARTS</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning, the
business of the cross being publicly proclaimed at Landaf, the
English standing on one side, and the Welsh on the other, many
persons of each nation took the cross, and we remained there that
night with William bishop of that place, <a
name="citation61a"></a><a href="#footnote61a"
class="citation">[61a]</a> a discreet and good man.&nbsp; The
word Landaf <a name="citation61b"></a><a href="#footnote61b"
class="citation">[61b]</a> signifies the church situated upon the
river Taf, and is now called the church of St. Teileau, formerly
bishop of that see.&nbsp; The archbishop having celebrated mass
early in the morning, before the high altar of the cathedral, we
immediately pursued our journey by the little cell of Ewenith <a
name="citation61c"></a><a href="#footnote61c"
class="citation">[61c]</a> to the <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>noble Cistercian monastery of Margan.
<a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a>&nbsp; This monastery, under the
direction of Conan, a learned and prudent abbot, was at this time
more celebrated for its charitable deeds than any other of that
order in Wales.&nbsp; On this account, it is an undoubted fact,
that, as a reward for that abundant charity which the monastery
had always, in times of need, exercised towards strangers and
poor persons, in a season of approaching famine, their corn and
provisions were perceptibly, by divine assistance, increased,
like the widow&rsquo;s cruise of oil by the means of the prophet
Elijah.&nbsp; About the time of its foundation, a young man of
those parts, by birth a Welshman, having claimed and endeavoured
to apply to his own use certain lands which had been given to the
monastery, by the instigation of the devil set on fire the best
barn belonging to the monks, which was filled with corn; but,
immediately becoming mad, he ran about the country in a
distracted state, nor ceased raving until he was seized by his
parents and bound.&nbsp; Having burst his bonds, and tired out
his keepers, he came the next morning to the gate of the
monastery, incessantly howling out that he was inwardly burnt by
the influence of the monks, and thus in a few days expired,
uttering the most miserable complaints.&nbsp; It happened also,
that a young man was struck by another in the guests&rsquo; hall;
but on the following day, by divine vengeance, the aggressor was,
in the presence of the fraternity, killed by an enemy, and his
lifeless body was laid out in the same spot in the hall where the
sacred house had been violated.&nbsp; In our time too, in a
period of scarcity, while great multitudes of poor were daily
crowding before the gates for relief, <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>by the unanimous consent of the
brethren, a ship was sent to Bristol to purchase corn for
charitable purposes.&nbsp; The vessel, delayed by contrary winds,
and not returning (but rather affording an opportunity for the
miracle), on the very day when there would have been a total
deficiency of corn, both for the poor and the convent, a field
near the monastery was found suddenly to ripen, more than a month
before the usual time of harvest: thus, divine Providence
supplied the brotherhood and the numerous poor with sufficient
nourishment until autumn.&nbsp; By these and other signs of
virtues, the place accepted by God began to be generally esteemed
and venerated.</p>
<p>It came to pass also in our days, during the period when the
four sons of Caradoc son of Iestin, and nephews of prince Rhys by
his sister, namely, Morgan, Meredyth, Owen, and Cadwallon, bore
rule for their father in those parts, that Cadwallon, through
inveterate malice, slew his brother Owen.&nbsp; But divine
vengeance soon overtook him; for on his making a hostile attack
on a certain castle, he was crushed to pieces by the sudden fall
of its walls: and thus, in the presence of a numerous body of his
own and his brother&rsquo;s forces, suffered the punishment which
his barbarous and unnatural conduct had so justly merited.</p>
<p>Another circumstance which happened here deserves
notice.&nbsp; A greyhound belonging to the aforesaid Owen, large,
beautiful, and curiously spotted with a variety of colours,
received seven wounds from arrows and lances, in the defence of
his master, and on his part did much injury to the enemy and
assassins.&nbsp; When his wounds were healed, he was sent to king
Henry II. by William earl of Gloucester, in testimony of so great
and extraordinary a deed.&nbsp; A dog, of all animals, is most
attached to man, and most easily distinguishes him; sometimes,
when deprived of his master, he refuses to live, and in his
master&rsquo;s defence is bold enough to brave death; ready,
therefore, to die, either with or for his master.&nbsp; <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>I do not
think it superfluous to insert here an example which Suetonius
gives in his book on the nature of animals, and which Ambrosius
also relates in his Exameron.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man, accompanied by
a dog, was killed in a remote part of the city of Antioch, by a
soldier, for the sake of plunder.&nbsp; The murderer, concealed
by the darkness of the morning, escaped into another part of the
city; the corpse lay unburied; a large concourse of people
assembled; and the dog, with bitter howlings, lamented his
master&rsquo;s fate.&nbsp; The murderer, by chance, passed that
way, and, in order to prove his innocence, mingled with the crowd
of spectators, and, as if moved by compassion, approached the
body of the deceased.&nbsp; The dog, suspending for a while his
moans, assumed the arms of revenge; rushed upon the man, and
seized him, howling at the same time in so dolorous a manner,
that all present shed tears.&nbsp; It was considered as a proof
against the murderer, that the dog seized him from amongst so
many, and would not let him go; and especially, as neither the
crime of hatred, envy, or injury, could possibly, in this case,
be urged against the dog.&nbsp; On account, therefore, of such a
strong suspicion of murder (which the soldier constantly denied),
it was determined that the truth of the matter should be tried by
combat.&nbsp; The parties being assembled in a field, with a
crowd of people around, the dog on one side, and the soldier,
armed with a stick of a cubit&rsquo;s length, on the other, the
murderer was at length overcome by the victorious dog, and
suffered an ignominious death on the common gallows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pliny and Solinus relate that a certain king, who was very
fond of dogs, and addicted to hunting, was taken and imprisoned
by his enemies, and in a most wonderful manner liberated, without
any assistance from his friends, by a pack of dogs, who had
spontaneously sequestered themselves in the mountainous and woody
regions, and from thence committed many atrocious acts of
depredation on the neighbouring herds and flocks.&nbsp; I shall
take this opportunity of mentioning what from <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>experience
and ocular testimony I have observed respecting the nature of
dogs.&nbsp; A dog is in general sagacious, but particularly with
respect to his master; for when he has for some time lost him in
a crowd, he depends more upon his nose than upon his eyes; and,
in endeavouring to find him, he first looks about, and then
applies his nose, for greater certainty, to his clothes, as if
nature had placed all the powers of infallibility in that
feature.&nbsp; The tongue of a dog possesses a medicinal quality;
the wolf&rsquo;s, on the contrary, a poisonous: the dog heals his
wounds by licking them, the wolf, by a similar practice, infects
them; and the dog, if he has received a wound in his neck or
head, or any part of his body where he cannot apply his tongue,
ingeniously makes use of his hinder foot as a conveyance of the
healing qualities to the parts affected.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PASSAGE OF THE RIVERS AVON AND
NETH&mdash;AND OF ABERTAWE AND GOER</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Continuing</span> our journey, <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a> not far from Margan, where the
alternate vicissitudes of a sandy shore and the tide commence, we
forded over the river Avon, having been considerably delayed by
the ebbing of the sea; and under the guidance of Morgan, eldest
son of Caradoc, proceeded along the sea-shore towards the river
Neth, which, on account of its quicksands, is the most dangerous
and inaccessible river in South Wales.&nbsp; A pack-horse
belonging <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>to the author, which had proceeded by the lower way near
the sea, although in the midst of many others, was the only one
which sunk down into the abyss, but he was at last, with great
difficulty, extricated, and not without some damage done to the
baggage and books.&nbsp; Yet, although we had Morgan, the prince
of that country, as our conductor, we did not reach the river
without great peril, and some severe falls; for the alarm
occasioned by this unusual kind of road, made us hasten our steps
over the quicksands, in opposition to the advice of our guide,
and fear quickened our pace; whereas, through these difficult
passages, as we there learned, the mode of proceeding should be
with moderate speed.&nbsp; But as the fords of that river
experience a change by every monthly tide, and cannot be found
after violent rains and floods, we did not attempt the ford, but
passed the river in a boat, leaving the monastery of Neth <a
name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a> on our right hand, approaching again to
the district of St. David&rsquo;s, and leaving the diocese of
Landaf (which we had entered at Abergevenny) behind us.</p>
<p>It happened in our days that David II., bishop of St.
David&rsquo;s, passing this way, and finding the ford agitated by
a recent storm, a chaplain of those parts, named Rotherch Falcus,
being conversant in the proper method of crossing these rivers,
undertook, at the desire of the bishop, the dangerous task of
trying the ford.&nbsp; Having mounted a large and powerful horse,
which had been <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>selected from the whole train for this purpose, he
immediately crossed the ford, and fled with great rapidity to the
neighbouring woods, nor could he be induced to return until the
suspension which he had lately incurred was removed, and a full
promise of security and indemnity obtained; the horse was then
restored to one party, and his service to the other.</p>
<p>Entering the province called Goer, <a
name="citation67a"></a><a href="#footnote67a"
class="citation">[67a]</a> we spent the night at the castle of
Sweynsei, <a name="citation67b"></a><a href="#footnote67b"
class="citation">[67b]</a> which in Welsh is called Abertawe, or
the fall of the river Tawe into the sea.&nbsp; The next morning,
the people being assembled after mass, and many having been
induced to take the cross, an aged man of that district, named
Cador, thus addressed the archbishop: &ldquo;My lord, if I now
enjoyed my former strength, and the vigour of youth, no alms
should ransom me, no desire of inactivity restrain me, from
engaging in the laudable undertaking you preach; but since my
weak age and the injuries of time deprive me of this desirable
benefit (for approaching years bring with them many comforts,
which those that are passed take away), if I cannot, owing to the
infirmity of my body, attain a full merit, yet suffer me, by
giving a tenth of all I possess, to attain a half.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then falling down at the feet of the archbishop, he deposited in
his hands, for <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>the service of the cross, the tenth of his estate,
weeping bitterly, and intreating from him the remission of one
half of the enjoined penance.&nbsp; After a short time he
returned, and thus continued: &ldquo;My lord, if the will directs
the action, and is itself, for the most part, considered as the
act, and as I have a full and firm inclination to undertake this
journey, I request a remission of the remaining part of the
penance, and in addition to my former gift, I will equal the sum
from the residue of my tenths.&rdquo;&nbsp; The archbishop,
smiling at his devout ingenuity, embraced him with
admiration.</p>
<p>On the same night, two monks, who waited in the
archbishop&rsquo;s chamber, conversing about the occurrences of
their journey, and the dangers of the road, one of them said
(alluding to the wildness of the country), &ldquo;This is a hard
province;&rdquo; the other (alluding to the quicksands), wittily
replied, &ldquo;Yet yesterday it was found too soft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short time before our days, a circumstance worthy of note
occurred in these parts, which Elidorus, a priest, most
strenuously affirmed had befallen himself.&nbsp; When a youth of
twelve years, and learning his letters, since, as Solomon says,
&ldquo;The root of learning is bitter, although the fruit is
sweet,&rdquo; in order to avoid the discipline and frequent
stripes inflicted on him by his preceptor, he ran away, and
concealed himself under the hollow bank of a river.&nbsp; After
fasting in that situation for two days, two little men of pigmy
stature appeared to him, saying, &ldquo;If you will come with us,
we will lead you into a country full of delights and
sports.&rdquo;&nbsp; Assenting and rising up, he followed his
guides through a path, at first subterraneous and dark, into a
most beautiful country, adorned with rivers and meadows, woods
and plains, but obscure, and not illuminated with the full light
of the sun.&nbsp; All the days were cloudy, and the nights
extremely dark, on account of the absence of the moon and
stars.&nbsp; The boy was brought before the king, and introduced
to him in the presence of the court; who, having examined him <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>for a long
time, delivered him to his son, who was then a boy.&nbsp; These
men were of the smallest stature, but very well proportioned in
their make; they were all of a fair complexion, with luxuriant
hair falling over their shoulders like that of women.&nbsp; They
had horses and greyhounds adapted to their size.&nbsp; They
neither ate flesh nor fish, but lived on milk diet, made up into
messes with saffron.&nbsp; They never took an oath, for they
detested nothing so much as lies.&nbsp; As often as they returned
from our upper hemisphere, they reprobated our ambition,
infidelities, and inconstancies; they had no form of public
worship, being strict lovers and reverers, as it seemed, of
truth.</p>
<p>The boy frequently returned to our hemisphere, sometimes by
the way he had first gone, sometimes by another: at first in
company with other persons, and afterwards alone, and made
himself known only to his mother, declaring to her the manners,
nature, and state of that people.&nbsp; Being desired by her to
bring a present of gold, with which that region abounded, he
stole, while at play with the king&rsquo;s son, the golden ball
with which he used to divert himself, and brought it to his
mother in great haste; and when he reached the door of his
father&rsquo;s house, but not unpursued, and was entering it in a
great hurry, his foot stumbled on the threshold, and falling down
into the room where his mother was sitting, the two pigmies
seized the ball which had dropped from his hand, and departed,
shewing the boy every mark of contempt and derision.&nbsp; On
recovering from his fall, confounded with shame, and execrating
the evil counsel of his mother, he returned by the usual track to
the subterraneous road, but found no appearance of any passage,
though he searched for it on the banks of the river for nearly
the space of a year.&nbsp; But since those calamities are often
alleviated by time, which reason cannot mitigate, and length of
time alone blunts the edge of our afflictions, and puts an end to
many evils, the youth having been brought back by his friends and
mother, and <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>restored to his right way of thinking, and to his
learning, in process of time attained the rank of
priesthood.&nbsp; Whenever David II., bishop of St.
David&rsquo;s, talked to him in his advanced state of life
concerning this event, he could never relate the particulars
without shedding tears.&nbsp; He had made himself acquainted with
the language of that nation, the words of which, in his younger
days, he used to recite, which, as the bishop often had informed
me, were very conformable to the Greek idiom.&nbsp; When they
asked for water, they said Ydor ydorum, which meant bring water,
for Ydor in their language, as well as in the Greek, signifies
water, from whence vessels for water are called
&#8017;&delta;&zeta;&iota;&alpha;&iota;; and D&ucirc;r also, in
the British language, signifies water.&nbsp; When they wanted
salt they said, Halgein ydorum, bring salt: salt is called
&#7937;&lambda; in Greek, and Halen in British, for that
language, from the length of time which the Britons (then called
Trojans, and afterwards Britons, from Brito, their leader)
remained in Greece after the destruction of Troy, became, in many
instances, similar to the Greek.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that so many languages should correspond in
one word, &#7937;&lambda; in Greek, Halen in British, and Halgein
in the Irish tongue, the g being inserted; Sal in Latin, because,
as Priscian says, &ldquo;the s is placed in some words instead of
an aspirate,&rdquo; as &#7937;&lambda;&sigmaf; in Greek is called
Sal in Latin,
&#7953;&mu;&iota;&mdash;semi&mdash;&#7953;&pi;&tau;&alpha;&mdash;septem&mdash;Sel
in French&mdash;the <i>a</i> being changed into
<i>e</i>&mdash;Salt in English, by the addition of <i>t</i> to
the Latin; Sout, in the Teutonic language: there are therefore
seven or eight languages agreeing in this one word.&nbsp; If a
scrupulous inquirer should ask my opinion of the relation here
inserted, I answer with Augustine, &ldquo;that the divine
miracles are to be admired, not discussed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor do I,
by denial, place bounds to the divine power, nor, by assent,
insolently extend what cannot be extended.&nbsp; But I always
call to mind the saying of St. Jerome; &ldquo;You will
find,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;many things incredible and
improbable, which nevertheless are true; for nature cannot in any
respect prevail <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>against the lord of nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; These things,
therefore, and similar contingencies, I should place, according
to the opinion of Augustine, among those particulars which are
neither to be affirmed, nor too positively denied.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PASSAGE OVER THE RIVERS LOCHOR AND
WENDRAETH; AND OF CYDWELI</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Thence</span> we proceeded towards the
river Lochor, <a name="citation71a"></a><a href="#footnote71a"
class="citation">[71a]</a> through the plains in which Howel, son
of Meredyth of Brecheinoc, after the decease of king Henry I.,
gained a signal victory over the English.&nbsp; Having first
crossed the river Lochor, and afterwards the water called
Wendraeth, <a name="citation71b"></a><a href="#footnote71b"
class="citation">[71b]</a> we arrived at the castle of Cydweli.
<a name="citation71c"></a><a href="#footnote71c"
class="citation">[71c]</a>&nbsp; In this district, after the
death of king Henry, whilst Gruffydd <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>son of Rhys, the prince of South
Wales, was engaged in soliciting assistance from North Wales, his
wife Gwenliana (like the queen of the Amazons, and a second
Penthesilea) led an army into these parts; but she was defeated
by Maurice de Londres, lord of that country, and Geoffrey, the
bishop&rsquo;s constable. <a name="citation72"></a><a
href="#footnote72" class="citation">[72]</a>&nbsp; Morgan, one of
her sons, whom she had arrogantly brought with her in that
expedition, was slain, and the other, Malgo, taken prisoner; and
she, with many of her followers, was put to death.&nbsp; During
the reign of king Henry I., when Wales enjoyed a state of
tranquillity, the above-mentioned Maurice had a forest in that
neighbourhood, well stocked with wild animals, and especially
deer, and was extremely tenacious of his venison.&nbsp; His wife
(for women are often very expert in deceiving men) made use of
this curious stratagem.&nbsp; Her husband possessed, on the side
of the wood next the sea, some extensive pastures, and large
flocks of sheep.&nbsp; Having made all the shepherds and chief
people in her house accomplices and favourers of her design, and
taking advantage of the simple courtesy of her husband, she thus
addressed him: &ldquo;It is wonderful that being lord over
beasts, you have ceased to exercise dominion over them; and by
not making use of your deer, do not now rule over them, but are
subservient to them; and behold how great an abuse arises from
too much patience; for they attack our sheep with such an
unheard-of rage, and unusual voracity, that from many they are
become few; from being innumerable, only numerous.&rdquo;&nbsp;
To make her story more probable, she caused some wool to be
inserted between the intestines of two stags which had been
embowelled; and her husband, thus artfully deceived, sacrificed
his deer to the rapacity of his dogs.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">TYWY
RIVER&mdash;CAERMARDYN&mdash;MONASTERY OF ALBELANDE</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> crossed the river Tywy in a
boat, we proceeded towards Caermardyn, leaving Lanstephan and
Talachar <a name="citation73a"></a><a href="#footnote73a"
class="citation">[73a]</a> on the sea-coast to our left.&nbsp;
After the death of king Henry II., Rhys, the son of Gruffydd,
took these two castles by assault; then, having laid waste, by
fire and sword, the provinces of Penbroch and Ros, he besieged
Caermardyn, but failed in his attempt.&nbsp; Caermardyn <a
name="citation73b"></a><a href="#footnote73b"
class="citation">[73b]</a> signifies the city of Merlin, because,
according to the British History, he was there said to have been
begotten of an incubus.</p>
<p>This ancient city is situated on the banks of the noble river
Tywy, surrounded by woods and pastures, and was strongly inclosed
with walls of brick, part of which are still standing; having
Cantref Mawr, the great cantred, or hundred, on the eastern side,
a safe refuge, in times of danger, to the inhabitants of South
Wales, on account of its thick woods; where is also the castle of
Dinevor, <a name="citation73c"></a><a href="#footnote73c"
class="citation">[73c]</a> built <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>on a lofty summit above the Tywy, the
royal seat of the princes of South Wales.&nbsp; In ancient times,
there were three regal palaces in Wales: Dinevor in South Wales,
Aberfrau in North Wales, situated in Anglesea, and Pengwern in
Powys, now called Shrewsbury (Slopesburia); Pengwern signifies
the head of a grove of alders.&nbsp; Recalling to mind those
poetical passages:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dolus an virtus quis in hoste
requirat?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Et si non recte possis quocunque modo
rem,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>my pen shrinks with abhorrence from the relation of the
enormous vengeance exercised by the court against its vassals,
within the comot of Caeo, in the Cantref Mawr.&nbsp; Near
Dinevor, on the other side of the river Tywy, in the Cantref
Bychan, or the little cantred, there is a spring which, like the
tide, ebbs and flows twice in twenty-four hours. <a
name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a"
class="citation">[74a]</a>&nbsp; Not far to the north of
Caermardyn, namely at Pencadair, <a name="citation74b"></a><a
href="#footnote74b" class="citation">[74b]</a> that is, the head
of the chair, when Rhys, the son of Gruffydd, was more by
stratagem than force compelled to surrender, and was carried away
into England, king Henry II. despatched a knight, born in
Britany, on whose wisdom and fidelity he could rely, under the
conduct of Guaidanus, dean of Cantref Mawr, to explore the
situation of Dinevor castle, and the strength of the
country.&nbsp; The priest, being desired to take the knight by
the easiest and best road to the castle, led him purposely aside
by the most difficult and inaccessible paths, and wherever they
passed through woods, the priest, to the general surprise of all
present, fed upon grass, asserting that, in times of need, the <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>inhabitants
of that country were accustomed to live upon herbs and
roots.&nbsp; The knight returning to the king, and relating what
had happened, affirmed that the country was uninhabitable, vile,
and inaccessible, and only affording food to a beastly nation,
living like brutes.&nbsp; At length the king released Rhys,
having first bound him to fealty by solemn oaths and the delivery
of hostages.</p>
<p>On our journey from Caermardyn towards the Cistercian
monastery called Alba Domus, <a name="citation75a"></a><a
href="#footnote75a" class="citation">[75a]</a> the archbishop was
informed of the murder of a young Welshman, who was devoutly
hastening to meet him; when turning out of the road, he ordered
the corpse to be covered with the cloak of his almoner, and with
a pious supplication commended the soul of the murdered youth to
heaven.&nbsp; Twelve archers of the adjacent castle of St. Clare,
<a name="citation75b"></a><a href="#footnote75b"
class="citation">[75b]</a> who had assassinated the young man,
were on the following day <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>signed with the cross at Alba Domus,
as a punishment for their crime.&nbsp; Having traversed three
rivers, the Taf, then the Cleddeu, under Lanwadein, <a
name="citation76a"></a><a href="#footnote76a"
class="citation">[76a]</a> and afterwards another branch of the
same river, we at length arrived at Haverford.&nbsp; This
province, from its situation between two rivers, has acquired the
name of Daugleddeu, <a name="citation76b"></a><a
href="#footnote76b" class="citation">[76b]</a> being enclosed and
terminated, as it were, by two swords, for cleddue, in the
British language, signifies a sword.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF HAVERFORD AND ROS</span></h3>
<p>A <span class="smcap">sermon</span> having been delivered at
Haverford <a name="citation76c"></a><a href="#footnote76c"
class="citation">[76c]</a> by the archbishop, and the word of God
preached to the people by the archdeacon, whose name appears on
the title-page of this work, many soldiers and plebeians were
induced to take the cross.&nbsp; It appeared wonderful and
miraculous, that, although the archdeacon addressed them both in
the Latin and French tongues, those persons who understood
neither of those languages were equally affected, and flocked in
great numbers to the cross.</p>
<p>An old woman of those parts, who for three preceding years had
been blind, having heard of the archbishop&rsquo;s arrival, sent
her son to the place where the sermon was to be preached, that he
might bring back to her some <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>particle, if only of the fringe of
his garment.&nbsp; The young man being prevented by the crowd
from approaching the archbishop, waited till the assembly was
dispersed, and then carried a piece of the earth on which the
preacher had stood.&nbsp; The mother received the gift with great
joy, and falling immediately on her knees, applied the turf to
her mouth and eyes; and thus, through the merits of the holy man,
and her own faith and devotion, recovered the blessing of sight,
which she had entirely lost.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of this province derived their origin from
Flanders, and were sent by king Henry I. to inhabit these
districts; a people brave and robust, ever most hostile to the
Welsh; a people, I say, well versed in commerce and woollen
manufactories; a people anxious to seek gain by sea or land, in
defiance of fatigue and danger; a hardy race, equally fitted for
the plough or the sword; a people brave and happy, if Wales (as
it ought to have been) had been dear to its sovereign, and had
not so frequently experienced the vindictive resentment and
ill-treatment of its governors.</p>
<p>A circumstance happened in the castle of Haverford during our
time, which ought not to be omitted.&nbsp; A famous robber was
fettered and confined in one of its towers, and was often visited
by three boys, the son of the earl of Clare, and two others, one
of whom was son of the lord of the castle, and the other his
grandson, sent thither for their education, and who applied to
him for arrows, with which he used to supply them.&nbsp; One day,
at the request of the children, the robber, being brought from
his dungeon, took advantage of the absence of the gaoler, closed
the door, and shut himself up with the boys.&nbsp; A great
clamour instantly arose, as well from the boys within, as from
the people without; nor did he cease, with an uplifted axe, to
threaten the lives of the children, until indemnity and security
were assured to him in the most ample manner.&nbsp; A similar
accident happened at Chateau-roux in France.&nbsp; The lord of
that <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>place
maintained in the castle a man whose eyes he had formerly put
out, but who, by long habit, recollected the ways of the castle,
and the steps leading to the towers.&nbsp; Seizing an opportunity
of revenge, and meditating the destruction of the youth, he
fastened the inward doors of the castle, and took the only son
and heir of the governor of the castle to the summit of a high
tower, from whence he was seen with the utmost concern by the
people beneath.&nbsp; The father of the boy hastened thither,
and, struck with terror, attempted by every possible means to
procure the ransom of his son, but received for answer, that this
could not be effected, but by the same mutilation of those lower
parts, which he had likewise inflicted on him.&nbsp; The father,
having in vain entreated mercy, at length assented, and caused a
violent blow to be struck on his body; and the people around him
cried out lamentably, as if he had suffered mutilation.&nbsp; The
blind man asked him where he felt the greatest pain? when he
replied in his reins, he declared it was false and prepared to
precipitate the boy.&nbsp; A second blow was given, and the lord
of the castle asserting that the greatest pains were at his
heart, the blind man expressing his disbelief, again carried the
boy to the summit of the tower.&nbsp; The third time, however,
the father, to save his son, really mutilated himself; and when
he exclaimed that the greatest pain was in his teeth; &ldquo;It
is true,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as a man who has had experience
should be believed, and thou hast in part revenged my
injuries.&nbsp; I shall meet death with more satisfaction, and
thou shalt neither beget any other son, nor receive comfort from
this.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, precipitating himself and the boy from
the summit of the tower, their limbs were broken, and both
instantly expired.&nbsp; The knight ordered a monastery to be
built on the spot for the soul of the boy, which is still extant,
and called De Doloribus.</p>
<p>It appears remarkable to me that the entire inheritance should
devolve on Richard, son of Tankard, governor of the aforesaid
castle of Haverford, being the <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>youngest son, and having many
brothers of distinguished character who died before him.&nbsp; In
like manner the dominion of South Wales descended to Rhys son of
Gruffyd, owing to the death of several of his brothers.&nbsp;
During the childhood of Richard, a holy man, named Caradoc, led a
pious and recluse life at St. Ismael, in the province of Ros, <a
name="citation79a"></a><a href="#footnote79a"
class="citation">[79a]</a> to whom the boy was often sent by his
parents with provisions, and he so ingratiated himself in the
eyes of the good man, that he very often promised him, together
with his blessing, the portion of all his brothers, and the
paternal inheritance.&nbsp; It happened that Richard, being
overtaken by a violent storm of rain, turned aside to the
hermit&rsquo;s cell; and being unable to get his hounds near him,
either by calling, coaxing, or by offering them food, the holy
man smiled; and making a gentle motion with his hand, brought
them all to him immediately.&nbsp; In process of time, when
Caradoc <a name="citation79b"></a><a href="#footnote79b"
class="citation">[79b]</a> <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>had happily completed the course of
his existence, Tankard, father of Richard, violently detained his
body, which by his last will he had bequeathed to the church of
St. David; but being suddenly seized with a severe illness, he
revoked his command.&nbsp; When this had happened to him a second
and a third time, and the corpse at last was suffered to be
conveyed away, and was proceeding over the sands of Niwegal
towards St. David&rsquo;s, a prodigious fall of rain inundated
the whole country; but the conductors of the sacred burthen, on
coming forth from their shelter, found the silken pall, with
which the bier was covered, dry and uninjured by the storm; and
thus the miraculous body of Caradoc was brought into the church
of St. Andrew and St. David, and with due solemnity deposited in
the left aisle, near the altar of the holy proto-martyr
Stephen.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that these people (the Flemings), from
the inspection of the right shoulders of rams, which have been
stripped of their flesh, and not roasted, but boiled, can
discover future events, or those which have passed and remained
long unknown. <a name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a>&nbsp; They know, also, what is
transpiring at a distant place, by a wonderful art, and a
prophetic kind of spirit.&nbsp; They declare, also, by means of
signs, the undoubted symptoms of approaching peace and war,
murders and fires, domestic adulteries, the state of the king,
his life and death.&nbsp; It happened in our time, that a man of
those parts, whose name was William Mangunel, a person of high
rank, and excelling all others in the aforesaid art, had a wife
big with child by her own husband&rsquo;s grandson.&nbsp; Well
aware of the fact, he ordered a ram from his own flock to be sent
to his wife, as a present from her neighbour, which was carried
to the cook, and dressed.&nbsp; At dinner, the <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>husband
purposely gave the shoulder-bone of the ram, properly cleaned, to
his wife, who was also well skilled in this art, for her
examination; when, having for a short time examined the secret
marks, she smiled, and threw the oracle down on the table.&nbsp;
Her husband, dissembling, earnestly demanded the cause of her
smiling, and the explanation of the matter.&nbsp; Overcome by his
entreaties, she answered: &ldquo;The man to whose fold this ram
belongs, has an adulterous wife, at this time pregnant by the
commission of incest with his own grandson.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
husband, with a sorrowful and dejected countenance, replied:
&ldquo;You deliver, indeed, an oracle supported by too much
truth, which I have so much more reason to lament, as the
ignominy you have published redounds to my own
injury.&rdquo;&nbsp; The woman, thus detected, and unable to
dissemble her confusion, betrayed the inward feelings of her mind
by external signs; shame and sorrow urging her by turns, and
manifesting themselves, now by blushes, now by paleness, and
lastly (according to the custom of women), by tears.&nbsp; The
shoulder of a goat was also once brought to a certain person,
instead of a ram&rsquo;s&mdash;both being alike, when cleaned;
who, observing for a short time the lines and marks, exclaimed,
&ldquo;Unhappy cattle, that never was multiplied! unhappy,
likewise, the owner of the cattle, who never had more than three
or four in one flock!&rdquo;&nbsp; Many persons, a year and a
half before the event, foresaw, by the means of shoulder-bones,
the destruction of their country, after the decease of king Henry
I., and, selling all their possessions, left their homes, and
escaped the impending ruin.</p>
<p>It happened also in Flanders, from whence this people came,
that a certain man sent a similar bone to a neighbour for his
inspection; and the person who carried it, on passing over a
ditch, broke wind, and wished it in the nostrils of the man on
whose account he was thus troubled.&nbsp; The person to whom the
bone was taken, on examination, said, &ldquo;May you have in your
own nose, that which you wished to be in mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
our time, a soothsayer, on <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>the inspection of a bone, discovered
not only a theft, and the manner of it, but the thief himself,
and all the attendant circumstances; he heard also the striking
of a bell, and the sound of a trumpet, as if those things which
were past were still performing.&nbsp; It is wonderful,
therefore, that these bones, like all unlawful conjurations,
should represent, by a counterfeit similitude to the eyes and
ears, things which are passed, as well as those which are now
going on.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF PENBROCH</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> province of Penbroch adjoins
the southern part of the territory of Ros, and is separated from
it by an arm of the sea.&nbsp; Its principal city, and the
metropolis of Demetia, is situated on an oblong rocky eminence,
extending with two branches from Milford Haven, from whence it
derived the name of Penbroch, which signifies the head of the
&aelig;stuary.&nbsp; Arnulph de Montgomery, <a
name="citation82a"></a><a href="#footnote82a"
class="citation">[82a]</a> in the reign of king Henry I., erected
here a slender fortress with stakes and turf, which, on returning
to England, he consigned to the care of Giraldus de Windesor, <a
name="citation82b"></a><a href="#footnote82b"
class="citation">[82b]</a> his constable and lieutenant-general,
a <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>worthy
and discreet man.&nbsp; Immediately on the death of Rhys son of
Tewdwr, who a short time before had been slain by the treachery
of his own troops at Brecheinoc, leaving his son, Gruffydd, a
child, the inhabitants of South Wales besieged the castle.&nbsp;
One night, when fifteen soldiers had deserted, and endeavoured to
escape from the castle in a small boat, on the following morning
Giraldus invested their armour bearers with the arms and estates
of their masters, and decorated them with the military
order.&nbsp; The garrison being, from the length of the siege,
reduced to the utmost want of provisions, the constable, with
great prudence and flattering hopes of success, caused four hogs,
which yet remained, to be cut into small pieces and thrown down
to the enemy from the fortifications.&nbsp; The next day, having
again recourse to a more refined stratagem, he contrived that a
letter, sealed with his own signet, should be found before the
house of Wilfred, <a name="citation83"></a><a href="#footnote83"
class="citation">[83]</a> bishop of St. David&rsquo;s, who was
then by chance in that neighbourhood, as if accidentally dropped,
stating that there would be no necessity of soliciting the
assistance of earl Arnulph for the next four months to
come.&nbsp; The contents of these letters being made known to the
army, the troops abandoned the siege of the castle, and retired
to their own homes.&nbsp; Giraldus, in order to make himself and
his dependants more secure, married Nest, the sister of Gruffydd,
prince of South Wales, by whom he had an illustrious progeny of
both sexes; and by whose means both the maritime parts of South
Wales were retained by the English, and the walls of Ireland
afterwards stormed, as our Vaticinal History declares.</p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>In our
time, a person residing at the castle of Penbroch, found a brood
of young weasels concealed within a fleece in his dwelling house,
which he carefully removed and hid.&nbsp; The mother, irritated
at the loss of her young, which she had searched for in vain,
went to a vessel of milk that had been set aside for the use of
the master&rsquo;s son, and raising herself up, polluted it with
her deadly poison; thus revenging, as it were, the loss of her
young, by the destruction of the child.&nbsp; The man, observing
what passed, carried the fleece back to its former place; when
the weasel, agitated by maternal solicitude, between hope and
fear, on finding again her young, began to testify her joy by her
cries and actions, and returning quickly to the vessel, overthrew
it; thus, in gratitude for the recovery of her own offspring,
saving that of her host from danger.</p>
<p>In another place, an animal of the same species had brought
out her young into a plain for the enjoyment of the sun and air;
when an insidious kite carried off one of them.&nbsp; Concealing
herself with the remainder behind some shrubs, grief suggested to
her a stratagem of exquisite revenge; she extended herself on a
heap of earth, as if dead, within sight of the plunderer, and (as
success always increases avidity) the bird immediately seized her
and flew away, but soon fell down dead by the bite of the
poisonous animal.</p>
<p>The castle called Maenor Pyrr, <a name="citation84"></a><a
href="#footnote84" class="citation">[84]</a> that is, the mansion
of <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>Pyrrus,
who also possessed the island of Chaldey, which the Welsh call
Inys Pyrr, or the island of Pyrrus, is distant about three miles
from Penbroch.&nbsp; It is excellently well defended by turrets
and bulwarks, and is situated on the summit of a hill extending
on the western side towards the sea-port, having on the northern
and southern sides a fine fish-pond under its walls, as
conspicuous for its grand appearance, as for the depth of its
waters, and a beautiful orchard on the same side, inclosed on one
part by a vineyard, and on the other by a wood, remarkable for
the projection of its rocks, and the height of its hazel
trees.&nbsp; On the right hand of the promontory, between the
castle and the church, near the site of a very large lake and
mill, a rivulet of never-failing water flows through a valley,
rendered sandy by the violence of the winds.&nbsp; Towards the
west, the Severn sea, bending its course to Ireland, enters a
hollow bay at some distance from the castle; and the southern
rocks, if extended a little further towards the north, would
render it a most excellent harbour for shipping.&nbsp; From this
point of sight, you will see almost all the ships from Great
Britain, which the east wind drives upon the Irish coast,
daringly brave the inconstant waves and raging sea.&nbsp; This
country is well supplied with corn, sea-fish, and imported wines;
and what is preferable to every other advantage, from its
vicinity to Ireland, it is tempered by a salubrious air.&nbsp;
Demetia, therefore, with its seven cantreds, is the most
beautiful, as well as the most powerful district of Wales;
Penbroch, the finest part of the province of Demetia; and the
place I have just described, the most delightful part of
Penbroch.&nbsp; It is evident, therefore, that Maenor Pirr is the
pleasantest spot in Wales; and the author may be pardoned for
having thus extolled his native soil, his genial territory, with
a profusion of praise and admiration.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>In this
part of Penbroch, unclean spirits have conversed, nor visibly,
but sensibly, with mankind; first in the house of Stephen Wiriet,
<a name="citation86a"></a><a href="#footnote86a"
class="citation">[86a]</a> and afterwards in the house of William
Not; <a name="citation86b"></a><a href="#footnote86b"
class="citation">[86b]</a> manifesting their presence by throwing
dirt at them, and more with a view of mockery than of
injury.&nbsp; In the house of William, they cut holes in the
linen and woollen garments, much to the loss of the owner of the
house and his guests; nor could any precaution, or even bolts,
secure them from these inconveniences.&nbsp; In the house of
Stephen, the spirit in a more extraordinary manner conversed with
men, and, in reply to their taunts, upbraided them openly with
everything they had done from their birth, and which they were
not willing should be known or heard by others.&nbsp; I do not
presume to assign the cause of this event, except that it is said
to be the presage of a sudden change from poverty to riches, or
rather from affluence to poverty and distress; as it was found to
be the case in both these instances.&nbsp; And it appears to me
very extraordinary that these places could not be purified from
such illusions, either by the sprinkling of holy water, or the
assistance of any other religious ceremony; for the priests
themselves, though protected by the crucifix, or the holy water,
on devoutly entering the house, were equally subject to the same
insults.&nbsp; From whence it appears that things pertaining to
the sacraments, as well as the sacraments themselves, defend us
from hurtful, but not from harmless things; from annoyances, but
not from illusions.&nbsp; It is worthy of note, that in our time,
a woman in Poitou was possessed by a demon, who, through her
mouth, artfully and acutely disputed with the learned.&nbsp; He
sometimes upbraided people with <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>their secret actions, and those
things which they wished not to hear; but when either the books
of the gospel, or the relics of saints, were placed upon the
mouth of the possessed, he fled to the lower part of her throat;
and when they were removed thither, he descended into her
belly.&nbsp; His appearance was indicated by certain inflations
and convulsions of the parts which he possessed, and when the
relics were again placed in the lower parts, he directly returned
to the upper.&nbsp; At length, when they brought the body of
Christ, and gave it to the patient, the demon answered, &ldquo;Ye
fools, you are doing nothing, for what you give her is not the
food of the body, but of the soul; and my power is confined to
the body, not to the soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when those persons
whom he had upbraided with their more serious actions, had
confessed, and returned from penance, he reproached them no
more.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have known, indeed,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I
have known but now I know not, (he spake this as it were a
reproach to others), and I hold my tongue, for what I know, I
know not.&rdquo;&nbsp; From which it appears, that after
confession and penance, the demons either do not know the sins of
men, or do not know them to their injury and disgrace; because,
as Augustine says, &ldquo;If man conceals, God discovers; if man
discovers, God conceals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some people are surprised that lightning often strikes our
places of worship, and damages the crosses and images of him who
was crucified, before the eyes of one who seeth all things, and
permits these circumstances to happen; to whom I shall only
answer with Ovid,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Summa petit livor, perflant altissima
venti,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Summa petunt dextra fulmina missa Jovis.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the same subject, Peter Abelard, in the presence of Philip
king of France, is said to have answered a Jew, who urged these
and similar things against the faith.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is true
that the lightning descending from on high, directs itself most
commonly to the highest object on <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>earth, and to those most resembling
its own nature; it never, therefore, injures your synagogues,
because no man ever saw or heard of its falling upon a
privy.&rdquo;&nbsp; An event worthy of note, happened in our time
in France.&nbsp; During a contention between some monks of the
Cistercian order, and a certain knight, about the limits of their
fields and lands, a violent tempest, in one night, utterly
destroyed and ruined the cultivated grounds of the monks, while
the adjoining territory of the knight remained undamaged.&nbsp;
On which occasion he insolently inveighed against the fraternity,
and publicly asserted that divine vengeance had thus punished
them for unlawfully keeping possession of his land; to which the
abbot wittily replied, &ldquo;It is by no means so; but that the
knight had more friends in that riding than the monastery;&rdquo;
and he clearly demonstrated that, on the other hand, the monks
had more enemies in it.</p>
<p>In the province of Penbroch, another instance occurred, about
the same time, of a spirit&rsquo;s appearing in the house of
Elidore de Stakepole, <a name="citation88"></a><a
href="#footnote88" class="citation">[88]</a> not only sensibly,
but visibly, under the form of a red-haired young man, who called
himself Simon.&nbsp; First seizing the keys from the person to
whom they were entrusted, he impudently assumed the
steward&rsquo;s office, which he managed so prudently and
providently, that all things seemed to abound under his care, and
there was no deficiency in the house.&nbsp; Whatever the master
or mistress secretly thought of having for their daily use or
provision, he procured with wonderful agility, and without any
previous directions, saying, &ldquo;You wished that to be done,
and it shall be done for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was also well
acquainted with their treasures and secret hoards, and sometimes
upbraided them on that account; for as often as they seemed to
act sparingly <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>and avariciously, he used to say, &ldquo;Why are you
afraid to spend that heap of gold or silver, since your lives are
of so short duration, and the money you so cautiously hoard up
will never do you any service?&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave the choicest
meat and drink to the rustics and hired servants, saying that
&ldquo;Those persons should be abundantly supplied, by whose
labours they were acquired.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whatever he determined
should be done, whether pleasing or displeasing to his master or
mistress (for, as we have said before, he knew all their
secrets), he completed in his usual expeditious manner, without
their consent.&nbsp; He never went to church, or uttered one
Catholic word.&nbsp; He did not sleep in the house, but was ready
at his office in the morning.</p>
<p>He was at length observed by some of the family to hold his
nightly converse near a mill and a pool of water; upon which
discovery he was summoned the next morning before the master of
the house and his lady, and, receiving his discharge, delivered
up the keys, which he had held for upwards of forty days.&nbsp;
Being earnestly interrogated, at his departure, who he was? he
answered, &ldquo;That he was begotten upon the wife of a rustic
in that parish, by a demon, in the shape of her husband,&rdquo;
naming the man, and his father-in-law, then dead, and his mother,
still alive; the truth of which the woman, upon examination,
openly avowed.&nbsp; A similar circumstance happened in our time
in Denmark.&nbsp; A certain unknown priest paid court to the
archbishop, and, from his obsequious behaviour and discreet
conduct, his general knowledge of letters and quick memory, soon
contracted a great familiarity with him.&nbsp; Conversing one day
with the archbishop about ancient histories and unknown events,
on which topic he most frequently heard him with pleasure, it
happened that when the subject of their discourse was the
incarnation of our Lord, he said, amongst other things,
&ldquo;Before Christ assumed human nature, the demons had great
power over mankind, which, at his coming, was much diminished; <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>insomuch that
they were dispersed on every side, and fled from his
presence.&nbsp; Some precipitated themselves into the sea, others
into the hollow parts of trees, or the clefts of rocks; and I
myself leaped into a well;&rdquo; on which he blushed for shame,
and took his departure.&nbsp; The archbishop, and those who were
with him, being greatly astonished at that speech, began to ask
questions by turns, and form conjectures; and having waited some
time (for he was expected to return soon), the archbishop ordered
some of his attendants to call him, but he was sought for in
vain, and never re-appeared.&nbsp; Soon afterwards, two priests,
whom the archbishop had sent to Rome, returned; and when this
event was related to them, they began to inquire the day and hour
on which the circumstance had happened?&nbsp; On being told it,
they declared that on the very same day and hour he had met them
on the Alps, saying, that he had been sent to the court of Rome,
on account of some business of his master&rsquo;s (meaning the
archbishop), which had lately occurred.&nbsp; And thus it was
proved, that a demon had deluded them under a human form.</p>
<p>I ought not to omit mentioning the falcons of these parts,
which are large, and of a generous kind, and exercise a most
severe tyranny over the river and land birds.&nbsp; King Henry
II. remained here some time, making preparations for his voyage
to Ireland; and being desirous of taking the diversion of
hawking, he accidentally saw a noble falcon perched upon a
rock.&nbsp; Going sideways round him, he let loose a fine Norway
hawk, which he carried on his left hand.&nbsp; The falcon, though
at first slower in its flight, soaring up to a great height,
burning with resentment, and in his turn becoming the aggressor,
rushed down upon his adversary with the greatest impetuosity, and
by a violent blow struck the hawk dead at the feet of the
king.&nbsp; From that time the king sent every year, about the
breeding season, for the falcons <a name="citation90"></a><a
href="#footnote90" class="citation">[90]</a> of <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>this country,
which are produced on the sea cliffs; nor can better be found in
any part of his dominions.&nbsp; But let us now return to our
Itinerary.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE PROGRESS BY CAMROS AND
NIWEGAL</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Haverford we proceeded on our
journey to Menevia, distant from thence about twelve miles, and
passed through Camros, <a name="citation91a"></a><a
href="#footnote91a" class="citation">[91a]</a> where, in the
reign of king Stephen, the relations and friends of a
distinguished young man, Giraldus, son of William, revenged his
death by a too severe retaliation on the men of Ros.&nbsp; We
then passed over Niwegal sands, at which place (during the winter
that king Henry II. spent in Ireland), as well as in almost all
the other western ports, a very remarkable circumstance
occurred.&nbsp; The sandy shores of South Wales, being laid bare
by the extraordinary violence of a storm, the surface of the
earth, which had been covered for many ages, re-appeared, and
discovered the trunks of trees cut off, standing in the very sea
itself, the strokes of the hatchet appearing as if made only
yesterday. <a name="citation91b"></a><a href="#footnote91b"
class="citation">[91b]</a>&nbsp; The soil was very black, and the
wood like ebony.&nbsp; By a wonderful revolution, the road for
ships became impassable, and looked, not like a shore, but like a
grove cut down, perhaps, at <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>the time of the deluge, or not long
after, but certainly in very remote ages, being by degrees
consumed and swallowed up by the violence and encroachments of
the sea.&nbsp; During the same tempest many sea fish were driven,
by the violence of the wind and waves, upon dry land.&nbsp; We
were well lodged at St. David&rsquo;s by Peter, bishop of the
see, a liberal man, who had hitherto accompanied us during the
whole of our journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span>, therefore, St. David&rsquo;s
is the head, and in times past was the metropolitan, city of
Wales, though now, alas! retaining more of the <i>name</i> than
of the <i>omen</i>, <a name="citation94"></a><a

forborne to weep over the obsequies of our ancient and undoubted
mother, to follow the mournful hearse, and to deplore with
tearful sighs the ashes of our half-buried matron.&nbsp; I shall,
therefore, endeavour briefly to declare to you in what manner,
from whence, and from what period the pall was first brought to
St. David&rsquo;s, and how it was taken away; how many prelates
were invested with the pall; and how many were despoiled thereof;
together with their respective names to this present day.</p>
<h3><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE SEE OF SAINT
DAVID&rsquo;S</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are informed by the British
histories, that Dubricius, archbishop of Caerleon, sensible of
the infirmities of age, or rather being desirous of leading a
life of contemplation, resigned his honours to David, who is said
to have been uncle to king Arthur; and by his interest the see
was translated to Menevia, although Caerleon, as we have observed
in the first book, was much better adapted for the episcopal
see.&nbsp; For Menevia is situated in a most remote corner of
land upon the Irish ocean, the soil stony and barren, neither
clothed with woods, distinguished by rivers, nor adorned by
meadows, ever exposed to the winds and tempests, and continually
subject to the hostile attacks of the Flemings on one side, and
of the Welsh on the other.&nbsp; For the holy men who settled
here, chose purposely such a retired habitation, that by avoiding
the noise of the world, and preferring an heremitical to a
pastoral life, they might more freely provide for &ldquo;that
part which shall not be taken away;&rdquo; for David was
remarkable for his sanctity and religion, as the history of his
life will testify.&nbsp; Amongst the many miracles recorded of
him, three appear to me the most worthy of admiration: his origin
and conception; his pre-election thirty years before his birth;
and what exceeds all, the sudden rising of the ground, at Brevy,
under his feet while preaching, to the great astonishment of all
the beholders.</p>
<p>Since the time of David, twenty-five archbishops presided over
the see of Menevia, whose names are here subjoined: David,
Cenauc, Eliud, who was also called <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Teilaus, Ceneu, Morwal, Haerunen,
Elwaed, Gurnuen, Lendivord, Gorwysc, Cogan, Cledauc, Anian,
Euloed, Ethelmen, Elauc, Malscoed, Sadermen, Catellus,
Sulhaithnai, Nonis, Etwal, Asser, Arthuael, Sampson.&nbsp; In the
time of Sampson, the pall was translated from Menevia in the
following manner: a disorder called the yellow plague, and by the
physicians the icteric passion, of which the people died in great
numbers, raged throughout Wales, at the time when Sampson held
the archiepiscopal see.&nbsp; Though a holy man, and fearless of
death, he was prevailed upon, by the earnest intreaties of his
people, to go on board a vessel, which was wafted, by a south
wind, to Britannia Armorica, <a name="citation96"></a><a
href="#footnote96" class="citation">[96]</a> where he and his
attendants were safely landed.&nbsp; The see of Dol being at that
time vacant, he was immediately elected bishop.&nbsp; Hence it
came to pass, that on account of the pall which Sampson had
brought thither with him, the succeeding bishops, even to our
times, always retained it.&nbsp; But during the presidency of the
archbishop of Tours, this adventitious dignity ceased; yet our
countrymen, through indolence or poverty, or rather owing to the
arrival of the English into the island, and the frequent
hostilities committed against them by the Saxons, lost their
archiepiscopal honours.&nbsp; But until the entire subjugation of
Wales by king Henry I., the Welsh bishops were always consecrated
by the bishop of St. David&rsquo;s; and he was consecrated by his
suffragans, without any profession or submission being made to
any other church.</p>
<p>From the time of Sampson to that of king Henry I., nineteen
bishops presided over this see: Ruelin, Rodherch, Elguin,
Lunuerd, Nergu, Sulhidir, Eneuris, Morgeneu, who was the first
bishop of St. David&rsquo;s who ate flesh, and was there killed
by pirates; and he appeared <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>to a certain bishop in Ireland on the
night of his death, shewing his wounds, and saying,
&ldquo;Because I ate flesh, I am become flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nathan, Ievan (who was bishop only one night), Argustel,
Morgenueth, Ervin, Tramerin, Joseph, Bleithud, Sulghein, Abraham,
Wilfred.&nbsp; Since the subjugation of Wales to the present
time, three only have held the see: in the reign of king Henry
I., Bernard; in the reign of king Stephen, David II.; and in the
reign of king Henry II., Peter, a monk of the order of Cluny; who
all, by the king&rsquo;s mandate, were consecrated at Canterbury;
as also Geoffrey, prior and canon of Lanthoni, who succeeded them
in the reign of king John, and was preferred to this see by the
interest of Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, and afterwards
consecrated by him.&nbsp; We do not hear that either before or
after that subjugation, any archbishop of Canterbury ever entered
the borders of Wales, except Baldwin, a monk of the Cistercian
order, abbot of Ford, and afterwards bishop of Worcester, who
traversed that rough, inaccessible, and remote country with a
laudable devotion for the service of the cross; and as a token of
investiture, celebrated mass in all the cathedral churches.&nbsp;
So that till lately the see of St. David&rsquo;s owed no
subjection to that of Canterbury, as may be seen in the English
History of Bede, who says that &ldquo;Augustine, bishop of the
Angles, after the conversion of king Ethelfred and the English
people, called together the bishops of Wales on the confines of
the West Saxons, as legate of the apostolic see.&nbsp; When the
seven bishops <a name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97"
class="citation">[97]</a> appeared, Augustine, sitting in his
chair, with Roman pride, did not rise up at their entrance.&nbsp;
Observing his haughtiness (after the example of a holy anchorite
of their nation), they immediately returned, and treated him and
his statutes with contempt, publicly proclaiming that they would
not acknowledge him for their archbishop; alleging, that if he
now refused to rise up to us, how much <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>more will he hold us in contempt, if
we submit to be subject to him?&rdquo;&nbsp; That there were at
that time seven bishops in Wales, and now only four, may be thus
accounted for; because perhaps there were formerly more cathedral
churches in Wales than there are at present, or the extent of
Wales might have been greater.&nbsp; Amongst so many bishops thus
deprived of their dignity, Bernard, the first French [<i>i.e.</i>
Norman] bishop of St. David&rsquo;s, alone defended the rights of
his church in a public manner; and after many expensive and
vexatious appeals to the court of Rome, would not have reclaimed
them in vain, if false witnesses had not publicly appeared at the
council of Rheims, before pope Eugenius, and testified that he
had made profession and submission to the see of
Canterbury.&nbsp; Supported by three auxiliaries, the favour and
intimacy of king Henry, a time of peace, and consequent plenty,
he boldly hazarded the trial of so great a cause, and so
confident was he of his just right, that he sometimes caused the
cross to be carried before him during his journey through
Wales.</p>
<p>Bernard, however commendable in some particulars, was
remarkable for his insufferable pride and ambition.&nbsp; For as
soon as he became courtier and a creature of the king&rsquo;s,
panting after English riches by means of translation, (a malady
under which all the English sent hither seem to labour), he
alienated many of the lands of his church without either
advantage or profit, and disposed of others so indiscreetly and
improvidently, that when ten carucates <a
name="citation98"></a><a href="#footnote98"
class="citation">[98]</a> of land were required for military
purposes, he would, with a liberal hand, give twenty or thirty;
and of the canonical rites and ordinances which he had miserably
and unhappily instituted at St. David&rsquo;s, he would hardly
make use of one, at most only of two or three.&nbsp; With respect
to the two sees of Canterbury and St. David&rsquo;s, I will
briefly explain my opinion of their <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>present state.&nbsp; On one side, you
will see royal favour, affluence of riches, numerous and opulent
suffragan bishops, great abundance of learned men and well
skilled in the laws; on the other side, a deficiency of all these
things, and a total want of justice; on which account the
recovery of its ancient rights will not easily be effected, but
by means of those great changes and vicissitudes which kingdoms
experience from various and unexpected events.</p>
<p>The spot where the church of St. David&rsquo;s stands, and was
founded in honour of the apostle St. Andrew, is called the Vale
of Roses; which ought rather to be named the vale of marble,
since it abounds with one, and by no means with the other.&nbsp;
The river Alun, a muddy and unproductive rivulet, <a
name="citation99a"></a><a href="#footnote99a"
class="citation">[99a]</a> bounding the churchyard on the
northern side, flows under a marble stone, called Lechlavar,
which has been polished by continual treading of passengers, and
concerning the name, size, and quality of which we have treated
in our Vaticinal History. <a name="citation99b"></a><a
href="#footnote99b" class="citation">[99b]</a>&nbsp; Henry II.,
on his return from Ireland, is said to have passed over this
stone, before he devoutly entered the church of St. Andrew and
St. David.&nbsp; Having left the following garrisons in Ireland,
namely, Hugh de Lacy (to whom he had given Meath in fee) in
Dublin, with twenty knights; Fitz-Stephen and Maurice Fitzgerald,
with other twenty; Humphrey de Bohun, Robert Fitz-Bernard, and
Hugh de Grainville at Waterford, with forty; and William
Fitz-Adelm and Philip de Braose at Wexford, with twenty; on the
second day of Easter, the king embarked at sunrise on board a
vessel in the outward port of Wexford, and, with a south wind,
landed about noon in the harbour of Menevia.&nbsp; Proceeding
towards the shrine of St. David, habited like a pilgrim, and
leaning on a staff, he met at the white gate a procession of the
canons of the church coming forth to <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>receive him with due honour and
reverence.&nbsp; As the procession solemnly moved along, a Welsh
woman threw herself at the king&rsquo;s feet, and made a
complaint against the bishop of the place, which was explained to
the king by an interpreter.&nbsp; The woman, immediate attention
not being paid to her petition, with violent gesticulation, and a
loud and impertinent voice, exclaimed repeatedly, &ldquo;Revenge
us this day, Lechlavar! revenge us and the nation in this
man!&rdquo;&nbsp; On being chidden and driven away by those who
understood the British language, she more vehemently and forcibly
vociferated in the like manner, alluding to the vulgar fiction
and proverb of Merlin, &ldquo;That a king of England, and
conqueror of Ireland, should be wounded in that country by a man
with a red hand, and die upon Lechlavar, on his return through
Menevia.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the name of that stone which
serves as a bridge over the river Alun, which divides the
cemetery from the northern side of the church.&nbsp; It was a
beautiful piece of marble, polished by the feet of passengers,
ten feet in length, six in breadth, and one in thickness.&nbsp;
Lechlavar signifies in the British language a talking stone. <a
name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100"
class="citation">[100]</a>&nbsp; There was an ancient tradition
respecting this stone, that at a time when a corpse was carried
over it for interment, it broke forth into speech, and by the
effort cracked in the middle, which fissure is still visible; and
on account of this barbarous and ancient superstition, the
corpses are no longer brought over it.&nbsp; The king, who had
heard the prophecy, approaching the stone, stopped for a short
time at the foot of it, and, looking earnestly at it, boldly
passed over; then, turning round, and looking towards the stone,
thus indignantly inveighed against the prophet: &ldquo;Who will
hereafter give credit to the lying Merlin?&rdquo;&nbsp; A person
standing by, and observing what had passed, in order to vindicate
the injury done to the prophet, replied, with a loud voice,
&ldquo;Thou art not that <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>king by whom Ireland is to be
conquered, or of whom Merlin prophesied!&rdquo;&nbsp; The king
then entering the church founded in honour of St. Andrew and St.
David, devoutly offered up his prayers, and heard mass performed
by a chaplain, whom alone, out of so large a body of priests,
Providence seems to have kept fasting till that hour, for this
very purpose.&nbsp; Having supped at St. David&rsquo;s, the king
departed for the castle of Haverford, distant about twelve
miles.&nbsp; It appears very remarkable to me, that in our days,
when David II. presided over the see, the river should have
flowed with wine, and that the spring, called Pistyll Dewi, or
the <i>Pipe</i> of David, from its flowing through a pipe into
the eastern side of the churchyard, should have run with
milk.&nbsp; The birds also of that place, called jackdaws, from
being so long unmolested by the clergy of the church, were grown
so tame and domesticated, as not to be afraid of persons dressed
in black.&nbsp; In clear weather the mountains of Ireland are
visible from hence, and the passage over the Irish sea may be
performed in one short day; on which account William, the son of
William the Bastard, and the second of the Norman kings in
England, who was called Rufus, and who had penetrated far into
Wales, on seeing Ireland from these rocks, is reported to have
said, &ldquo;I will summon hither all the ships of my realm, and
with them make a bridge to attack that country.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Which speech being related to Murchard, prince of Leinster, he
paused awhile, and answered, &ldquo;Did the king add to this
mighty threat, If God please?&rdquo; and being informed that he
had made no mention of God in his speech, rejoicing in such a
prognostic, he replied, &ldquo;Since that man trusts in human,
not divine power, I fear not his coming.&rdquo;</p>

102</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE JOURNEY BY CEMMEIS&mdash;THE
MONASTERY OF ST. DOGMAEL</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> archbishop having celebrated
mass early in the morning before the high altar of the church of
St. David, and enjoined to the archdeacon (Giraldus) the office
of preaching to the people, hastened through Cemmeis <a
name="citation102a"></a><a href="#footnote102a"
class="citation">[102a]</a> to meet prince Rhys at Aberteive. <a
name="citation102b"></a><a href="#footnote102b"
class="citation">[102b]</a>&nbsp; Two circumstances occurred in
the province of Cemmeis, the one in our own time, the other a
little before, which I think right not to pass over in
silence.&nbsp; In our time, a young man, native of this country,
during a severe illness, suffered as violent a persecution from
toads, <a name="citation102c"></a><a href="#footnote102c"
class="citation">[102c]</a> as if the reptiles of the whole
province had come to him by agreement; and though destroyed by
his nurses and friends, they increased again on all sides in
infinite numbers, like hydras&rsquo; heads.&nbsp; His attendants,
both friends and strangers, being wearied out, he was drawn up in
a kind of bag, into a high tree, stripped of its leaves, and
shred; nor was he there secure from his venomous enemies, for
they crept up the tree in great numbers, and consumed him even to
the very bones.&nbsp; The young man&rsquo;s name was Sisillus
Esceir-hir, that is, Sisillus Long Leg.&nbsp; It is also recorded
that by the hidden but never unjust will of God, another man
suffered a similar persecution from rats.&nbsp; In the same
province, during the reign of king Henry I., a rich man, who had
a residence on the northern side of the Preseleu <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>mountains,
<a name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a"
class="citation">[103a]</a> was warned for three successive
nights, by dreams, that if he put his hand under a stone which
hung over the spring of a neighbouring well, called the fountain
of St. Bernacus, <a name="citation103b"></a><a
href="#footnote103b" class="citation">[103b]</a> he would find
there a golden torques.&nbsp; Obeying the admonition on the third
day, he received, from a viper, a deadly wound in his finger; but
as it appears that many treasures have been discovered through
dreams, it seems to me probable that, with respect to rumours, in
the same manner as to dreams, some ought, and some ought not, to
be believed.</p>
<p>I shall not pass over in silence the circumstance which
occurred in the principal castle of Cemmeis at Lanhever, <a
name="citation103c"></a><a href="#footnote103c"
class="citation">[103c]</a> in our days.&nbsp; Rhys, son of
Gruffydd, by the instigation of his son Gruffydd, a cunning and
artful man, took away by force, from William, son of Martin (de
Tours), his son-in-law, the castle of Lanhever, notwithstanding
he had solemnly sworn, by the most precious relics, that his
indemnity and security should be faithfully maintained, and,
contrary to his word and oath, gave it to his son Gruffydd; but
since &ldquo;A sordid prey has not a good ending,&rdquo; the
Lord, who by the mouth of his prophet, exclaims &ldquo;Vengeance
is mine, and I will repay!&rdquo; ordained that the castle should
be taken away from the contriver of this wicked plot, Gruffydd,
and bestowed upon the man in the world he most hated, his brother
Malgon.&nbsp; Rhys, also, about two years afterwards, intending
to disinherit his own daughter, and two granddaughters <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>and
grandsons, by a singular instance of divine vengeance, was taken
prisoner by his sons in battle, and confined in this same castle;
thus justly suffering the greatest disgrace and confusion in the
very place where he had perpetrated an act of the most consummate
baseness.&nbsp; I think it also worthy to be remembered, that at
the time this misfortune befell him, he had concealed in his
possession, at Dinevor, the collar of St. Canauc of Brecknock,
for which, by divine vengeance, he merited to be taken prisoner
and confined.</p>
<p>We slept that night in the monastery of St. Dogmael, where, as
well as on the next day at Aberteivi, we were handsomely
entertained by prince Rhys.&nbsp; On the Cemmeis side of the
river, not far from the bridge, the people of the neighbourhood
being assembled together, and Rhys and his two sons, Malgon and
Gruffydd, being present, the word of the Lord was persuasively
preached both by the archbishop and the archdeacon, and many were
induced to take the cross; one of whom was an only son, and the
sole comfort of his mother, far advanced in years, who,
steadfastly gazing on him, as if inspired by the Deity, uttered
these words:&mdash;&ldquo;O, most beloved Lord Jesus Christ, I
return thee hearty thanks for having conferred on me the blessing
of bringing forth a son, whom thou mayest think worthy of thy
service.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another woman at Aberteivi, of a very
different way of thinking, held her husband fast by his cloak and
girdle, and publicly and audaciously prevented him from going to
the archbishop to take the cross; but, three nights afterwards,
she heard a terrible voice, saying, &ldquo;Thou hast taken away
my servant from me, therefore what thou most lovest shall be
taken away from thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; On her relating this vision to
her husband, they were struck with mutual terror and amazement;
and on falling asleep again, she unhappily overlaid her little
boy, whom, with more affection than prudence, she had taken to
bed with her.&nbsp; The husband, relating to the bishop of the
diocese both the vision and its fatal prediction, took the cross,
<a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>which
his wife spontaneously sewed on her husband&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Near the head of the bridge where the sermons were delivered,
the people immediately marked out the site for a chapel, <a
name="citation105a"></a><a href="#footnote105a"
class="citation">[105a]</a> on a verdant plain, as a memorial of
so great an event; intending that the altar should be placed on
the spot where the archbishop stood while addressing the
multitude; and it is well known that many miracles (the
enumeration of which would be too tedious to relate) were
performed on the crowds of sick people who resorted hither from
different parts of the country.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE RIVER TEIVI, CARDIGAN, AND
EMELYN</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> noble river Teivi flows here,
and abounds with the finest salmon, more than any other river of
Wales; it has a productive fishery near Cilgerran, which is
situated on the summit of a rock, at a place called Canarch Mawr,
<a name="citation105b"></a><a href="#footnote105b"
class="citation">[105b]</a> the ancient residence of St. Ludoc,
where the river, falling from a great height, forms a cataract,
which the salmon ascend, by leaping from the bottom to the top of
a rock, which is about the height of the longest spear, and would
appear wonderful, were it not the nature of that species of fish
to leap: hence they have received the name of salmon, from
<i>salio</i>.&nbsp; Their particular manner of leaping (as I have
specified in my Topography of Ireland) is thus: fish of this
kind, naturally swimming against the <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>course of the river (for as birds
fly against the wind, so do fish swim against the stream), on
meeting with any sudden obstacle, bend their tail towards their
mouth, and sometimes, in order to give a greater power to their
leap, they press it with their mouth, and suddenly freeing
themselves from this circular form, they spring with great force
(like a bow let loose) from the bottom to the top of the leap, to
the great astonishment of the beholders.&nbsp; The church
dedicated to St. Ludoc, <a name="citation106a"></a><a
href="#footnote106a" class="citation">[106a]</a> the mill,
bridge, salmon leap, an orchard with a delightful garden, all
stand together on a small plot of ground.&nbsp; The Teivi has
another singular particularity, being the only river in Wales, or
even in England, which has beavers; <a name="citation106b"></a><a
href="#footnote106b" class="citation">[106b]</a> in Scotland they
are said to be found in one river, but are very scarce.&nbsp; I
think it not a useless labour, to insert a few remarks respecting
the nature of these animals&mdash;the manner in which they bring
their materials from the woods to the water, and with what skill
they connect them in the construction of their dwellings in the
midst of rivers; their means of defence on the eastern and <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>western
sides against hunters; and also concerning their fish-like
tails.</p>
<p>The beavers, in order to construct their castles in the middle
of rivers, make use of the animals of their own species instead
of carts, who, by a wonderful mode of carnage, convey the timber
from the woods to the rivers.&nbsp; Some of them, obeying the
dictates of nature, receive on their bellies the logs of wood cut
off by their associates, which they hold tight with their feet,
and thus with transverse pieces placed in their mouths, are drawn
along backwards, with their cargo, by other beavers, who fasten
themselves with their teeth to the raft.&nbsp; The moles use a
similar artifice in clearing out the dirt from the cavities they
form by scraping.&nbsp; In some deep and still corner of the
river, the beavers use such skill in the construction of their
habitations, that not a drop of water can penetrate, or the force
of storms shake them; nor do they fear any violence but that of
mankind, nor even that, unless well armed.&nbsp; They entwine the
branches of willows with other wood, and different kinds of
leaves, to the usual height of the water, and having made
within-side a communication from floor to floor, they elevate a
kind of stage, or scaffold, from which they may observe and watch
the rising of the waters.&nbsp; In the course of time, their
habitations bear the appearance of a grove of willow trees, rude
and natural without, but artfully constructed within.&nbsp; This
animal can remain in or under water at its pleasure, like the
frog or seal, who shew, by the smoothness or roughness of their
skins, the flux and reflux of the sea.&nbsp; These three animals,
therefore, live indifferently under the water, or in the air, and
have short legs, broad bodies, stubbed tails, and resemble the
mole in their corporal shape.&nbsp; It is worthy of remark, that
the beaver has but four teeth, two above, and two below, which
being broad and sharp, cut like a carpenter&rsquo;s axe, and as
such he uses them.&nbsp; They make excavations and dry hiding
places in the banks near their dwellings, and when they hear the
<a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>stroke
of the hunter, who with sharp poles endeavours to penetrate them,
they fly as soon as possible to the defence of their castle,
having first blown out the water from the entrance of the hole,
and rendered it foul and muddy by scraping the earth, in order
thus artfully to elude the stratagems of the well-armed hunter,
who is watching them from the opposite banks of the river.&nbsp;
When the beaver finds he cannot save himself from the pursuit of
the dogs who follow him, that he may ransom his body by the
sacrifice of a part, he throws away that, which by natural
instinct he knows to be the object sought for, and in the sight
of the hunter castrates himself, from which circumstance he has
gained the name of Castor; and if by chance the dogs should chase
an animal which had been previously castrated, he has the
sagacity to run to an elevated spot, and there lifting up his
leg, shews the hunter that the object of his pursuit is
gone.&nbsp; Cicero speaking of them says, &ldquo;They ransom
themselves by that part of the body, for which they are chiefly
sought.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Juvenal says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;Qui se<br />
Eunuchum ipse facit, cupiens evadere damno<br />
Testiculi.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And St. Bernard,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Prodit enim castor proprio de corpore
velox<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reddere quas sequitur hostis avarus opes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, therefore, in order to preserve his skin, which is
sought after in the west, and the medicinal part of his body,
which is coveted in the east, although he cannot save himself
entirely, yet, by a wonderful instinct and sagacity, he
endeavours to avoid the stratagems of his pursuers.&nbsp; The
beavers have broad, short tails, thick, like the palm of a hand,
which they use as a rudder in swimming; and although the rest of
their body is hairy, this part, like that of seals, is without
hair, and smooth; upon which account, in Germany and the arctic
regions, where beavers abound, great and religious persons, in <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>times of
fasting, eat the tails of this fish-like animal, as having both
the taste and colour of fish.</p>
<p>We proceeded on our journey from Cilgerran towards
Pont-Stephen, <a name="citation109a"></a><a href="#footnote109a"
class="citation">[109a]</a> leaving Cruc Mawr, <i>i.e.</i> the
great hill, near Aberteivi, on our left hand.&nbsp; On this spot
Gruffydd, son of Rhys ap Tewdwr, soon after the death of king
Henry I., by a furious onset gained a signal victory against the
English army, which, by the murder of the illustrious Richard de
Clare, near Abergevenny (before related), had lost its leader and
chief. <a name="citation109b"></a><a href="#footnote109b"
class="citation">[109b]</a>&nbsp; A tumulus is to be seen on the
summit of the aforesaid hill, and the inhabitants affirm that it
will adapt itself to persons of all stature and that if any
armour is left there entire in the evening, it will be found,
according to vulgar tradition, broken to pieces in the
morning.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE JOURNEY BY PONT STEPHEN, THE ABBEY
OF STRATFLUR, LANDEWI BREVI, AND LHANPADARN VAWR</span></h3>
<p>A <span class="smcap">sermon</span> having been preached on
the following morning at Pont Stephen, <a
name="citation109c"></a><a href="#footnote109c"
class="citation">[109c]</a> by the archbishop and archdeacon, and
also by two abbots of the Cistercian order, John of Albadomus,
and Sisillus of Stratflur, <a name="citation109d"></a><a
href="#footnote109d" class="citation">[109d]</a> who faithfully
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>attended
us in those parts, and as far as North Wales, many persons were
induced to take the cross.&nbsp; We proceeded to Stratflur, where
we passed the night.&nbsp; On the following morning, having on
our right the lofty mountains of Moruge, which in Welsh are
called Ellennith, <a name="citation110a"></a><a
href="#footnote110a" class="citation">[110a]</a> we were met near
the side of a wood by Cyneuric son of Rhys, accompanied by a body
of light-armed youths.&nbsp; This young man was of a fair
complexion, with curled hair, tall and handsome; clothed only,
according to the custom of his country, with a thin cloak and
inner garment, his legs and feet, regardless of thorns and
thistles were left bare; a man, not adorned by art, but nature;
bearing in his presence an innate, not an acquired, dignity of
manners.&nbsp; A sermon having been preached to these three young
men, Gruffydd, Malgon, and Cyneuric, in the presence of their
father, prince Rhys, and the brothers disputing about taking the
cross, at length Malgon strictly promised that he would accompany
the archbishop to the king&rsquo;s court, and would obey the
king&rsquo;s and archbishop&rsquo;s counsel, unless prevented by
them.&nbsp; From thence we passed through Landewi Brevi, <a
name="citation110b"></a><a href="#footnote110b"
class="citation">[110b]</a> that is, the church of David of
Brevi, situated on the summit of that hill which had formerly
risen up under his feet whilst preaching, during the period of
that celebrated synod, when all the bishops, abbots, and clergy
of Wales, and many other persons, were collected <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>thither on
account of the Pelagian heresy, which, although formerly exploded
from Britain by Germanus, bishop of Auxerre, had lately been
revived in these parts.&nbsp; At this place David was reluctantly
raised to the archbishopric, by the unanimous consent and
election of the whole assembly, who by loud acclamations
testified their admiration of so great a miracle.&nbsp; Dubricius
had a short time before resigned to him this honour in due form
at Caerleon, from which city the metropolitan see was transferred
to St. David&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Having rested that night at Lhanpadarn Vawr, <a
name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a> or the church of Paternus the Great,
we attracted many persons to the service of Christ on the
following morning.&nbsp; It is remarkable that this church, like
many others in Wales and Ireland, has a lay abbot; for a bad
custom has prevailed amongst the clergy, of appointing the most
powerful people of a parish stewards, or, rather, patrons, of
their churches; who, in process of time, from a desire of gain,
have usurped the whole right, appropriating to their own use the
possession of all the lands, leaving only to the clergy the
altars, with their tenths and oblations, and assigning even these
to their sons and relations in the church.&nbsp; Such defenders,
or rather destroyers, of the church, have caused themselves to be
called abbots, and presumed to attribute to themselves a title,
as well as estates, to which they have no just claim.&nbsp; In
this state we found the church of Lhanpadarn, without a
head.&nbsp; A certain old man, waxen old in iniquity (whose name
was Eden Oen, son of Gwaithwoed), being abbot, and his sons
officiating at the altar.&nbsp; But in the reign of king Henry
I., when the authority of the English prevailed in Wales, the
monastery of St. Peter at Gloucester held quiet possession of
this church; but after his death, the English being driven out,
the monks were expelled from their cloisters, and their places
supplied by the same <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>violent intrusion of clergy and
laity, which had formerly been practised.&nbsp; It happened that
in the reign of king Stephen, who succeeded Henry I., a knight,
born in Armorican Britain, having travelled through many parts of
the world, from a desire of seeing different cities, and the
manners of their inhabitants, came by chance to Lhanpadarn.&nbsp;
On a certain feast-day, whilst both the clergy and people were
waiting for the arrival of the abbot to celebrate mass, he
perceived a body of young men, armed, according to the custom of
their country, approaching towards the church; and on enquiring
which of them was the abbot, they pointed out to him a man
walking foremost, with a long spear in his hand.&nbsp; Gazing on
him with amazement, he asked, &ldquo;If the abbot had not another
habit, or a different staff, from that which he now carried
before him?&rdquo;&nbsp; On their answering, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;I have seen indeed and heard this day a wonderful
novelty!&rdquo; and from that hour he returned home, and finished
his labours and researches.&nbsp; This wicked people boasts, that
a certain bishop <a name="citation112"></a><a href="#footnote112"
class="citation">[112]</a> of their church (for it formerly was a
cathedral) was murdered by their predecessors; and on this
account, chiefly, they ground their claims of right and
possession.&nbsp; No public complaint having been made against
their conduct, we have thought it more prudent to pass over, for
the present, the enormities of this wicked race with
dissimulation, than exasperate them by a further relation.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">OF THE RIVER DEVI, AND THE LAND OF THE
SONS OF CONAN</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Approaching</span> to the river Devi, <a
name="citation113a"></a><a href="#footnote113a"
class="citation">[113a]</a> which divides North and South Wales,
the bishop of St. David&rsquo;s, and Rhys the son of Gruffydd,
who with a liberality peculiarly praiseworthy in so illustrious a
prince, had accompanied us from the castle of Aberteivi,
throughout all Cardiganshire, to this place, returned home.&nbsp;
Having crossed the river in a boat, and quitted the diocese of
St. David&rsquo;s, we entered the land of the sons of Conan, or
Merionyth, the first province of Venedotia on that side of the
country, and belonging to the bishopric of Bangor. <a
name="citation113b"></a><a href="#footnote113b"
class="citation">[113b]</a>&nbsp; We slept that night at
Towyn.&nbsp; Early next morning, Gruffydd son of Conan <a
name="citation113c"></a><a href="#footnote113c"
class="citation">[113c]</a> came to meet us, humbly and devoutly
asking pardon for having so long delayed his attention to the
archbishop.&nbsp; On the same day, we ferried over the bifurcate
river Maw, <a name="citation113d"></a><a href="#footnote113d"
class="citation">[113d]</a> where Malgo, son of Rhys, who had
attached himself to the archbishop, as a companion to the
king&rsquo;s court, discovered a ford near <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>the
sea.&nbsp; That night we lay at Llanvair, <a
name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a"
class="citation">[114a]</a> that is the church of St. Mary, in
the province of Ardudwy. <a name="citation114b"></a><a
href="#footnote114b" class="citation">[114b]</a>&nbsp; This
territory of Conan, and particularly Merionyth, is the rudest and
roughest district of all Wales; the ridges of its mountains are
very high and narrow, terminating in sharp peaks, and so
irregularly jumbled together, that if the shepherds conversing or
disputing with each other from their summits, should agree to
meet, they could scarcely effect their purpose in the course of
the whole day.&nbsp; The lances of this country are very long;
for as South Wales excels in the use of the bow, so North Wales
is distinguished for its skill in the lance; insomuch that an
iron coat of mail will not resist the stroke of a lance thrown at
a small distance.&nbsp; The next morning, the youngest son of
Conan, named Meredyth, met us at the passage of a bridge,
attended by his people, where many persons were signed with the
cross; amongst whom was a fine young man of his suite, and one of
his intimate friends; and Meredyth, observing that the cloak, on
which the cross was to be sewed, appeared of too thin and of too
common a texture, with a flood of tears, threw him down his
own.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">PASSAGE OF TRAETH MAWR AND TRAETH BACHAN,

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> continued our journey over the
Traeth Mawr, <a name="citation115a"></a><a href="#footnote115a"
class="citation">[115a]</a> and Traeth Bachan, <a
name="citation115b"></a><a href="#footnote115b"
class="citation">[115b]</a> that is, the greater and the smaller
arm of the sea, where two stone castles have newly been erected;
one called Deudraeth, belonging to the sons of Conan, situated in
Evionyth, towards the northern mountains; the other named Carn
Madryn, the property of the sons of Owen, built on the other side
of the river towards the sea, on the head-land Lleyn. <a

class="citation">[115c]</a>&nbsp; Traeth, in the Welsh language,
signifies a tract of sand flooded by the tides, and left bare
when the sea ebbs.&nbsp; We had before passed over the noted
rivers, the Dissenith, <a name="citation115d"></a><a
href="#footnote115d" class="citation">[115d]</a> between the Maw
and Traeth Mawr, and the Arthro, between the Traeth Mawr and
Traeth Bachan.&nbsp; We slept that night at Nevyn, on the eve of
Palm Sunday, where the archdeacon, after long inquiry and
research, is said to have found Merlin Sylvestris. <a

class="citation">[115e]</a></p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>Beyond Lleyn, there is a small island inhabited by very
religious monks, called C&aelig;libes, or Colidei.&nbsp; This
island, either from the wholesomeness of its climate, owing to
its vicinity to Ireland, or rather from some miracle obtained by
the merits of the saints, has this wonderful peculiarity, that
the oldest people die first, because diseases are uncommon, and
scarcely any die except from extreme old age.&nbsp; Its name is
Enlli in the Welsh, and Berdesey <a name="citation116a"></a><a
href="#footnote116a" class="citation">[116a]</a> in the Saxon
language; and very many bodies of saints are said to be buried
there, and amongst them that of Daniel, bishop of Bangor.</p>
<p>The archbishop having, by his sermon the next day, induced
many persons to take the cross, we proceeded towards Banchor,
passing through Caernarvon, <a name="citation116b"></a><a
href="#footnote116b" class="citation">[116b]</a> that is, the
castle of Arvon; it is called Arvon, the province opposite to
M&ocirc;n, because it is so situated with respect to the island
of Mona.&nbsp; Our road leading us to a steep valley, <a
name="citation116c"></a><a href="#footnote116c"
class="citation">[116c]</a> with many broken ascents and
descents, we dismounted <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>from our horses, and proceeded on
foot, rehearsing, as it were, by agreement, some experiments of
our intended pilgrimage to Jerusalem.&nbsp; Having traversed the
valley, and reached the opposite side with considerable fatigue,
the archbishop, to rest himself and recover his breath, sat down
on an oak which had been torn up by the violence of the winds;
and relaxing into a pleasantry highly laudable in a person of his
approved gravity, thus addressed his attendants: &ldquo;Who
amongst you, in this company, can now delight our wearied ears by
whistling?&rdquo; which is not easily done by people out of
breath.&nbsp; He affirming that he could, if he thought fit, the
sweet notes are heard, in an adjoining wood, of a bird, which
some said was a woodpecker, and others, more correctly, an
aureolus.&nbsp; The woodpecker is called in French, <i>spec</i>,
and with its strong bill, perforates oak trees; the other bird in
called aureolus, from the golden tints of its feathers, and at
certain seasons utters a sweet whistling note instead of a
song.&nbsp; Some persons having remarked, that the nightingale
was never heard in this country, the archbishop, with a
significant smile, replied, &ldquo;The nightingale followed wise
counsel, and never came into Wales; but we, unwise counsel, who
have penetrated and gone through it.&rdquo;&nbsp; We remained
that night at Banchor, <a name="citation117"></a><a
href="#footnote117" class="citation">[117]</a> <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>the
metropolitan see of North Wales, and were well entertained by the
bishop of the diocese. <a name="citation118a"></a><a
href="#footnote118a" class="citation">[118a]</a>&nbsp; On the
next day, mass being celebrated by the archbishop before the high
altar, the bishop of that see, at the instance of the archbishop
and other persons, more importunate than persuasive, was
compelled to take the cross, to the general concern of all his
people of both sexes, who expressed their grief on this occasion
by loud and lamentable vociferations.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE ISLAND OF MONA</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> hence, we crossed over a small
arm of the sea to the island of Mona, <a
name="citation118b"></a><a href="#footnote118b"
class="citation">[118b]</a> distant from thence about two miles,
where Roderic, the younger son of Owen, attended by nearly all
the inhabitants of the island, and many others from the adjacent
countries, came in a devout manner to meet us.&nbsp; Confession
having been made in a place near the shore, where the surrounding
rocks seemed to form a natural theatre, <a
name="citation118c"></a><a href="#footnote118c"
class="citation">[118c]</a> many persons were <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>induced to
take the cross, by the persuasive discourses of the archbishop,
and Alexander, our interpreter, archdeacon of that place, and of
Sisillus, abbot of Stratflur.&nbsp; Many chosen youths of the
family of Roderic were seated on an opposite rock, and not one of
them could be prevailed upon to take the cross, although the
archbishop and others most earnestly exhorted them, but in vain,
by an address particularly directed to them.&nbsp; It came to
pass within three days, as if by divine vengeance, that these
young men, with many others, pursued some robbers of that
country.&nbsp; Being discomfited and put to flight, some were
slain, others mortally wounded, and the survivors voluntarily
assumed that cross they had before despised.&nbsp; Roderic, also,
who a short time before had incestuously married the daughter of
Rhys, related to him by blood in the third degree, in order, by
the assistance of that prince, to be better able to defend
himself against the sons of his brothers, whom he had
disinherited, not paying attention to the wholesome admonitions
of the archbishop on this subject, was a little while afterwards
dispossessed of all his lands by their means; thus deservedly
meeting with disappointment from the very source from which he
expected support.&nbsp; The <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>island of Mona contains three
hundred and forty-three vills, considered equal to three
cantreds.&nbsp; Cantred, a compound word from the British and
Irish languages, is a portion of land equal to one hundred
vills.&nbsp; There are three islands contiguous to Britain, on
its different sides, which are said to be nearly of an equal
size&mdash;the Isle of Wight on the south, Mona on the west, and
Mania (Man) on the north-west side.&nbsp; The two first are
separated from Britain by narrow channels; the third is much
further removed, lying almost midway between the countries of
Ulster in Ireland and Galloway in Scotland.&nbsp; The island of
Mona is an arid and stony land, rough and unpleasant in its
appearance, similar in its exterior qualities to the land of
Pebidion, <a name="citation120a"></a><a href="#footnote120a"
class="citation">[120a]</a> near St. David&rsquo;s, but very
different as to its interior value.&nbsp; For this island is
incomparably more fertile in corn than any other part of Wales,
from whence arose the British proverb, &ldquo;Mon mam Cymbry,
Mona mother of Wales;&rdquo; and when the crops have been
defective in all other parts of the country, this island, from
the richness of its soil and abundant produce, has been able to
supply all Wales.</p>
<p>As many things within this island are worthy of remark, I
shall not think it superfluous to make mention of some of
them.&nbsp; There is a stone here resembling a human thigh, <a
name="citation120b"></a><a href="#footnote120b"
class="citation">[120b]</a> which possesses this innate virtue,
that whatever distance it may be carried, it returns, of its own
accord, the following night, as has often been experienced by the
inhabitants.&nbsp; Hugh, earl of Chester, <a
name="citation120c"></a><a href="#footnote120c"
class="citation">[120c]</a> <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>in the reign of king Henry I.,
having by force occupied this island and the adjacent country,
heard of the miraculous power of this stone, and, for the purpose
of trial, ordered it to be fastened, with strong iron chains, to
one of a larger size, and to be thrown into the sea.&nbsp; On the
following morning, however, according to custom, it was found in
its original position, on which account the earl issued a public
edict, that no one, from that time, should presume to move the
stone from its place.&nbsp; A countryman, also, to try the powers
of this stone, fastened it to his thigh, which immediately became
putrid, and the stone returned to its original situation.</p>
<p>There is in the same island a stony hill, not very large or
high, from one side of which, if you cry aloud, you will not be
heard on the other; and it is called (by anti-phrasis) the rock
of hearers.&nbsp; In the northern part of Great Britain
(Northumberland) so named by the English, from its situation
beyond the river Humber, there is a hill of a similar nature,
where if a loud horn or trumpet is sounded on one side, it cannot
be heard on the opposite one.&nbsp; There is also in this island
the church of St. Tefredaucus, <a name="citation121"></a><a
href="#footnote121" class="citation">[121]</a> into which Hugh,
earl of Shrewsbury, (who, together with the earl of Chester, had
forcibly entered Anglesey), on a certain night put some dogs,
which on the following morning were found mad, and he himself
died within a month; for some pirates, from the Orcades, having
entered the port of the island in their long vessels, the earl,
apprised of their approach, boldly met them, rushing into the sea
upon a spirited horse.&nbsp; <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>The commander of the expedition,
Magnus, standing on the prow of the foremost ship, aimed an arrow
at him; and, although the earl was completely equipped in a coat
of mail, and guarded in every part of his body except his eyes,
the unlucky weapon struck his right eye, and, entering his brain,
he fell a lifeless corpse into the sea.&nbsp; The victor, seeing
him in this state, proudly and exultingly exclaimed, in the
Danish tongue, &ldquo;Leit loup,&rdquo; let him leap; and from
this time the power of the English ceased in Anglesey.&nbsp; In
our times, also, when Henry II. was leading an army into North
Wales, where he had experienced the ill fortune of war in a
narrow, woody pass near Coleshulle, he sent a fleet into
Anglesey, and began to plunder the aforesaid church, and other
sacred places.&nbsp; But the divine vengeance pursued him, for
the inhabitants rushed upon the invaders, few against many,
unarmed against armed; and having slain great numbers, and taken
many prisoners, gained a most complete and bloody victory.&nbsp;
For, as our Topography of Ireland testifies, that the Welsh and
Irish are more prone to anger and revenge than any other nations,
the saints, likewise, of those countries appear to be of a more
vindictive nature.</p>
<p>Two noble persons, and uncles of the author of this book, were
sent thither by the king; namely, Henry, son of king Henry I.,
and uncle to king Henry II., by Nest, daughter of Rhys, prince of
South Wales; and Robert Fitz-Stephen, brother to Henry, a man who
in our days, shewing the way to others, first attacked Ireland,
and whose fame is recorded in our Vaticinal History.&nbsp; Henry,
actuated by too much valour, and ill supported, was pierced by a
lance, and fell amongst the foremost, to the great concern of his
attendants; and Robert, despairing of being able to defend
himself, was badly wounded, and escaped with difficulty to the
ships.</p>
<p>There is a small island, almost adjoining to Anglesey, which
is inhabited by hermits, living by manual labour, and serving
God.&nbsp; It is remarkable that when, by the <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>influence
of human passions, any discord arises among them, all their
provisions are devoured and infected by a species of small mice,
with which the island abounds; but when the discord ceases, they
are no longer molested.&nbsp; Nor is it to be wondered at, if the
servants of God sometimes disagree, since Jacob and Esau
contended in the womb of Rebecca, and Paul and Barnabas differed;
the disciples also of Jesus disputed which of them should be the
greatest, for these are the temptations of human infirmity; yet
virtue is often made perfect by infirmity, and faith is increased
by tribulations.&nbsp; This island is called in Welsh, Ynys
Lenach, <a name="citation123a"></a><a href="#footnote123a"
class="citation">[123a]</a> or the ecclesiastical island, because
many bodies of saints are deposited there, and no woman is
suffered to enter it.</p>
<p>We saw in Anglesey a dog, who accidentally had lost his tail,
and whose whole progeny bore the same defect.&nbsp; It is
wonderful that nature should, as it were, conform itself in this
particular to the accident of the father.&nbsp; We saw also a
knight, named Earthbald, born in Devonshire, whose father,
denying the child with which his mother was pregnant, and from
motives of jealousy accusing her of inconstancy, nature alone
decided the controversy by the birth of the child, who, by a
miracle, exhibited on his upper lip a scar, similar to one his
father bore in consequence of a wound he had received from a
lance in one of his military expeditions.&nbsp; Stephen, the son
of Earthbald, had a similar mark, the accident being in a manner
converted into nature.&nbsp; A like miracle of nature occurred in
earl Alberic, son of Alberic earl of Veer, <a
name="citation123b"></a><a href="#footnote123b"
class="citation">[123b]</a> whose father, during the pregnancy of
his <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>mother, the daughter of Henry of Essex, having laboured
to procure a divorce, on account of the ignominy of her father,
the child, when born, had the same blemish in its eye, as the
father had got from a casual hurt.&nbsp; These defects may be
entailed on the offspring, perhaps, by the impression made on the
memory by frequent and steady observation; as it is reported that
a queen, accustomed to see the picture of a negro in her chamber,
unexpectedly brought forth a black child, and is exculpated by
Quintilian, on account of the picture.&nbsp; In like manner it
happened to the spotted sheep, given by Laban out of his flock to
his nephew Jacob, and which conceived by means of variegated
rods. <a name="citation124"></a><a href="#footnote124"
class="citation">[124]</a>&nbsp; Nor is the child always affected
by the mother&rsquo;s imagination alone, but sometimes by that of
the father; for it is well known that a man, seeing a passenger
near him, who was convulsed both behind and before, on going home
and telling his wife that he could not get the impression of this
sight off his mind, begat a child who was affected in a similar
manner.</p>

125</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PASSAGE OF THE RIVER CONWY IN A BOAT, AND
OF DINAS EMRYS</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> our return to Banchor from Mona,
we were shown the tombs of prince Owen and his younger brother
Cadwalader, <a name="citation125a"></a><a href="#footnote125a"
class="citation">[125a]</a> who were buried in a double vault
before the high altar, although Owen, on account of his public
incest with his cousin-german, had died excommunicated by the
blessed martyr St. Thomas, the bishop of that see having been
enjoined to seize a proper opportunity of removing his body from
the church.&nbsp; We continued our journey on the sea coast,
confined on one side by steep rocks, and by the sea on the other,
towards the river Conwy, which preserves its waters unadulterated
by the sea.&nbsp; Not far from the source of the river Conwy, at
the head of the Eryri mountain, which on this side extends itself
towards the north, stands Dinas Emrys, that is, the promontory of
Ambrosius, where Merlin <a name="citation125b"></a><a
href="#footnote125b" class="citation">[125b]</a> uttered his
prophecies, whilst Vortigern was seated upon the bank.&nbsp;
There were two Merlins; the one called Ambrosius who prophesied
in the time of king Vortigern, <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>was begotten by a demon incubus, and
found at Caermardin, from which circumstance that city derived
its name of Caermardin, or the city of Merlin; the other Merlin,
born in Scotland, was named Celidonius, from the Celidonian wood
in which he prophesied; and Sylvester, because when engaged in
martial conflict, he discovered in the air a terrible monster,
and from that time grew mad, and taking shelter in a wood, passed
the remainder of his days in a savage state.&nbsp; This Merlin
lived in the time of king Arthur, and is said to have prophesied
more fully and explicitly than the other.&nbsp; I shall pass over
in silence what was done by the sons of Owen in our days, after
his death, or while he was dying, who, from the wicked desire of
reigning, totally disregarded the ties of fraternity; but I shall
not omit mentioning another event which occurred likewise in our
days.&nbsp; Owen, <a name="citation126"></a><a
href="#footnote126" class="citation">[126]</a> son of Gruffyth,
prince of North Wales, had many sons, but only one legitimate,
namely, Iorwerth Drwyndwn, which in Welsh means flat-nosed, who
had a son named Llewelyn.&nbsp; This young man, being only twelve
years of age, began, during the period of our journey, to molest
his uncles David and Roderic, the sons of Owen by Christiana, his
cousin-german; and although they had divided amongst themselves
all North Wales, except the land of Conan, and although David,
having married the sister of king Henry II., by whom he had one
son, was powerfully supported by the English, yet within a few
years the legitimate son, destitute of lands or money (by the aid
of divine vengeance), bravely expelled from North Wales those who
were born in public incest, though supported by their own wealth
and by that of <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>others, leaving them nothing but what the liberality of
his own mind and the counsel of good men from pity suggested: a
proof that adulterous and incestuous persons are displeasing to
God.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE MOUNTAINS OF ERYRI</span></h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">must</span> not pass over in silence the
mountains called by the Welsh Eryri, but by the English Snowdon,
or Mountains of Snow, which gradually increasing from the land of
the sons of Conan, and extending themselves northwards near
Deganwy, seem to rear their lofty summits even to the clouds,
when viewed from the opposite coast of Anglesey.&nbsp; They are
said to be of so great an extent, that according to an ancient
proverb, &ldquo;As Mona could supply corn for all the inhabitants
of Wales, so could the Eryri mountains afford sufficient pasture
for all the herds, if collected together.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence
these lines of Virgil may be applied to them:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Et quantum longis carpent armenta
diebus,<br />
Exigua tautum gelidus ros nocte reponet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is cropt by day the night renews,<br />
Shedding refreshful stores of cooling dews.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the highest parts of these mountains are two lakes worthy
of admiration.&nbsp; The one has a floating island in it, which
is often driven from one side to the other by the force of the
winds; and the shepherds behold with astonishment their cattle,
whilst feeding, carried to the distant parts of the lake.&nbsp; A
part of the bank naturally bound together by the roots of willows
and other shrubs may have been broken off, and increased by the
alluvion of the earth from the shore; and being continually <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>agitated by
the winds, which in so elevated a situation blow with great
violence, it cannot reunite itself firmly with the banks.&nbsp;
The other lake is noted for a wonderful and singular
miracle.&nbsp; It contains three sorts of fish&mdash;eels, trout,
and perch, all of which have only one eye, the left being
wanting; but if the curious reader should demand of me the
explanation of so extraordinary a circumstance, I cannot presume
to satisfy him.&nbsp; It is remarkable also, that in two places
in Scotland, one near the eastern, the other near the western
sea, the fish called mullets possess the same defect, having no
left eye.&nbsp; According to vulgar tradition, these mountains
are frequented by an eagle who, perching on a fatal stone every
fifth holiday, in order to satiate her hunger with the carcases
of the slain, is said to expect war on that same day, and to have
almost perforated the stone by cleaning and sharpening her
beak.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE PASSAGE BY DEGANWY AND RUTHLAN, AND
THE SEE OF LANELWY, AND OF COLESHULLE</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> crossed the river Conwy, <a
name="citation128a"></a><a href="#footnote128a"
class="citation">[128a]</a> or rather an arm of the sea, under
Deganwy, leaving the Cistercian monastery of Conwy <a
name="citation128b"></a><a href="#footnote128b"
class="citation">[128b]</a> on the western bank of the river to
our right hand, we arrived at Ruthlan, a noble castle on the <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>river
Cloyd, belonging to David, the eldest son of Owen <a
name="citation129a"></a><a href="#footnote129a"
class="citation">[129a]</a> where, at the earnest invitation of
David himself, we were handsomely entertained that night.</p>
<p>There is a spring not far from Ruthlan, in the province of
Tegengel, <a name="citation129b"></a><a href="#footnote129b"
class="citation">[129b]</a> which not only regularly ebbs and
flows like the sea, twice in twenty-four hours, but at other
times frequently rises and falls both by night and day.&nbsp;
Trogus Pompeius says, &ldquo;that there is a town of the
Garamantes, where there is a spring which is hot and cold
alternately by day and night.&rdquo; <a
name="citation129c"></a><a href="#footnote129c"
class="citation">[129c]</a></p>
<p>Many persons in the morning having been persuaded to dedicate
themselves to the service of Christ, we proceeded from Ruthlan to
the small cathedral church of Lanelwy; <a
name="citation129d"></a><a href="#footnote129d"
class="citation">[129d]</a> from whence (the archbishop having
celebrated mass) we continued our journey through a country rich
in minerals of silver, where money is sought in the bowels of the
earth, to the little cell of Basinwerk, <a
name="citation129e"></a><a href="#footnote129e"
class="citation">[129e]</a> where we passed the night.&nbsp; The
following day we traversed a long quicksand, and not without some
degree of apprehension, leaving the woody district of Coleshulle,
<a name="citation129f"></a><a href="#footnote129f"
class="citation">[129f]</a> or hill of coal, on our right hand,
where Henry II., who in our time, actuated by youthful and
indiscreet ardour, made a hostile irruption into Wales, and
presuming to pass through that narrow and woody defile,
experienced a signal defeat, and a very heavy loss <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>of men. <a
name="citation130"></a><a href="#footnote130"
class="citation">[130]</a>&nbsp; The aforesaid king invaded Wales
three times with an army; first, North Wales at the
above-mentioned place; secondly, South Wales, by the sea-coast of
Glamorgan and Goer, penetrating as far as Caermarddin and
Pencadair, and returning by Ellennith and Melenith; and thirdly,
the country of Powys, near Oswaldestree; but in all these
expeditions the king was unsuccessful, because he placed no
confidence in the prudent and well-informed chieftains of the
country, but was principally advised by people remote from the
marches, and ignorant of the manners and customs of the
natives.&nbsp; In every expedition, as the artificer is to be
trusted in his trade, so the advice of those people should be
consulted, who, by a long residence in the country, are become
conversant with the manners and customs of the natives; and to
whom it is of high importance that the power of the hostile
nation, with whom, by a long and continued warfare, they have
contracted an implacable enmity and hatred, should be weakened or
destroyed, as we have set forth in our Vaticinal History.</p>
<p>In this wood of Coleshulle, a young Welshman was killed while
passing through the king&rsquo;s army; the greyhound who
accompanied him did not desert his master&rsquo;s corpse for
eight days, though without food; but faithfully defended it from
the attacks of dogs, wolves, and birds of prey, with a wonderful
attachment.&nbsp; What son to his father, what Nisus to Euryalus,
what Polynices to Tydeus, what Orestes to Pylades, would have
shewn such an affectionate regard?&nbsp; As a mark of favour to
the dog, who was almost starved to death, the English, although
bitter enemies to the Welsh, ordered the body, now nearly putrid,
to be deposited in the ground with the accustomed offices of
humanity.</p>

131</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE PASSAGE OF THE RIVER DEE, AND OF
CHESTER</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> crossed the river Dee below
Chester, (which the Welsh call Doverdwy), on the third day before
Easter, or the day of absolution (holy Thursday), we reached
Chester.&nbsp; As the river Wye towards the south separates Wales
from England, so the Dee near Chester forms the northern
boundary.&nbsp; The inhabitants of these parts assert, that the
waters of this river change their fords every month, and, as it
inclines more towards England or Wales, they can, with certainty,
prognosticate which nation will be successful or unfortunate
during the year.&nbsp; This river derives its origin from the
lake Penmelesmere, <a name="citation131a"></a><a
href="#footnote131a" class="citation">[131a]</a> and, although it
abounds with salmon, yet none are found in the lake.&nbsp; It is
also remarkable, that this river is never swollen by rains, but
often rises by the violence of the winds.</p>
<p>Chester boasts of being the burial-place of Henry, <a
name="citation131b"></a><a href="#footnote131b"
class="citation">[131b]</a> a Roman emperor, who, after having
imprisoned his carnal and spiritual father, pope Paschal, gave
himself up to penitence; and, becoming a voluntary exile in this
country, ended his days in solitary retirement.&nbsp; It is also
asserted, that the remains of Harold are here deposited.&nbsp; He
was the last of the Saxon kings in England, and as a punishment
for his perjury, was defeated in the battle of Hastings, fought
against the Normans.&nbsp; Having received many wounds, and lost
his left eye by an <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>arrow in that engagement, he is said to have escaped to
these parts, where, in holy conversation, leading the life of an
anchorite, and being a constant attendant at one of the churches
of this city, he is believed to have terminated his days happily.
<a name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132"
class="citation">[132]</a>&nbsp; The truth of these two
circumstances was declared (and not before known) by the dying
confession of each party.&nbsp; We saw here, what appeared novel
to us, cheese made of deer&rsquo;s milk; for the countess and her
mother keeping tame deer, presented to the archbishop three small
cheeses made from their milk.</p>
<p>In this same country was produced, in our time, a cow
partaking of the nature of a stag, resembling its mother in the
fore parts and the stag in its hips, legs, and feet, and having
the skin and colour of the stag; but, partaking more of the
nature of the domestic than of the wild animal, it remained with
the herd of cattle.&nbsp; A bitch also was pregnant by a monkey,
and produced a litter of whelps resembling a monkey before, and
the dog behind; which the rustic keeper of the military hall
seeing with astonishment and abhorrence, immediately killed with
the stick he carried in his hand; thereby incurring the severe
resentment and anger of his lord, when the latter became
acquainted with the circumstance.</p>
<p>In our time, also, a woman was born in Chester without hands,
to whom nature had supplied a remedy for that defect by the
flexibility and delicacy of the joints of her feet, with which
she could sew, or perform any work with thread or scissors, as
well as other women.</p>

133</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE JOURNEY BY THE WHITE MONASTERY,
OSWALDESTREE, POWYS, AND SHREWSBURY</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> feast of Easter having been
observed with due solemnity, and many persons, by the
exhortations of the archbishop, signed with the cross, we
directed our way from Chester to the White Monastery, <a
name="citation133a"></a><a href="#footnote133a"
class="citation">[133a]</a> and from thence towards Oswaldestree;
where, on the very borders of Powys, we were met by Gruffydd son
of Madoc, and Elissa, princes of that country, and many others;
some few of whom having been persuaded to take the cross (for
several of the multitude had been previously signed by Reiner, <a
name="citation133b"></a><a href="#footnote133b"
class="citation">[133b]</a> the bishop of that place), Gruffydd,
prince of the district, publicly adjured, in the presence of the
archbishop, his cousin-german, Angharad, daughter of prince Owen,
whom, according to the vicious custom of the country, he had long
considered as his wife.&nbsp; We slept at Oswaldestree, or the
tree of St. Oswald, and were most sumptuously entertained after
the English manner, by William Fitz-Alan, <a
name="citation133c"></a><a href="#footnote133c"
class="citation">[133c]</a> a noble and liberal <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>young
man.&nbsp; A short time before, whilst Reiner was preaching, a
robust youth being earnestly exhorted to follow the example of
his companions in taking the cross, answered, &ldquo;I will not
follow your advice until, with this lance which I bear in my
hand, I shall have avenged the death of my lord,&rdquo; alluding
to Owen, son of Madoc, a distinguished warrior, who had been
maliciously and treacherously slain by Owen Cyfeilioc, his
cousin-german; and while he was thus venting his anger and
revenge, and violently brandishing his lance, it suddenly snapped
asunder, and fell disjointed in several pieces to the ground, the
handle only remaining in his hand.&nbsp; Alarmed and astonished
at this omen, which he considered as a certain signal for his
taking the cross, he voluntarily offered his services.</p>
<p>In this third district of Wales, called Powys, there are most
excellent studs put apart for breeding, and deriving their origin
from some fine Spanish horses, which Robert de Belesme, <a
name="citation134a"></a><a href="#footnote134a"
class="citation">[134a]</a> earl of Shrewsbury, brought into this
country: on which account the horses sent from hence are
remarkable for their majestic proportion and astonishing
fleetness.</p>
<p>Here king Henry II. entered Powys, in our days, upon an
expensive, though fruitless, expedition. <a
name="citation134b"></a><a href="#footnote134b"
class="citation">[134b]</a>&nbsp; Having dismembered the hostages
whom he had previously received, he was compelled, by a sudden
and violent fall <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>of rain, to retreat with his army.&nbsp; On the
preceding day, the chiefs of the English army had burned some of
the Welsh churches, with the villages and churchyards; upon which
the sons of Owen the Great, with their light-armed troops,
stirred up the resentment of their father and the other princes
of the country, declaring that they would never in future spare
any churches of the English.&nbsp; When nearly the whole army was
on the point of assenting to this determination, Owen, a man of
distinguished wisdom and moderation&mdash;the tumult being in
some degree subsided&mdash;thus spake: &ldquo;My opinion, indeed,
by no means agrees with yours, for we ought to rejoice at this
conduct of our adversary; for, unless supported by divine
assistance, we are far inferior to the English; and they, by
their behaviour, have made God their enemy, who is able most
powerfully to avenge both himself and us.&nbsp; We therefore most
devoutly promise God that we will henceforth pay greater
reverence than ever to churches and holy places.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After which, the English army, on the following night,
experienced (as has before been related) the divine
vengeance.</p>
<p>From Oswaldestree, we directed our course towards Shrewsbury
(<i>Salopesburia</i>), which is nearly surrounded by the river
Severn, where we remained a few days to rest and refresh
ourselves; and where many people were induced to take the cross,
through the elegant sermons of the archbishop and
archdeacon.&nbsp; We also excommunicated Owen de Cevelioc,
because he alone, amongst the Welsh princes, did not come to meet
the archbishop with his people.&nbsp; Owen was a man of more
fluent speech than his contemporary princes, and was conspicuous
for the good management of his territory.&nbsp; Having generally
favoured the royal cause, and opposed the measures of his own
chieftains, he had contracted a great familiarity with king Henry
II.&nbsp; Being with the king at table at Shrewsbury, Henry, as a
mark of peculiar honour and regard, sent him one of his own
loaves; he immediately brake it into small pieces, like
alms-bread, and having, <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>like an almoner, placed them at a
distance from him, he took them up one by one and ate them.&nbsp;
The king requiring an explanation of this proceeding, Owen, with
a smile, replied, &ldquo;I thus follow the example of my
lord;&rdquo; keenly alluding to the avaricious disposition of the
king, who was accustomed to retain for a long time in his own
hands the vacant ecclesiastical benefices.</p>
<p>It is to be remarked that three princes, <a
name="citation136"></a><a href="#footnote136"
class="citation">[136]</a> distinguished for their justice,
wisdom, and princely moderation, ruled, <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>in our
time, over the three provinces of Wales: Owen, son of Gruffydd,
in Venedotia, or North Wales; Meredyth, his grandson, son of
Gruffydd, who died early in life, in South Wales; and Owen de
Cevelioc, in Powys.&nbsp; But two other princes were highly
celebrated for their generosity; Cadwalader, son of Gruffydd, in
North Wales, and Gruffydd of Maelor, son of Madoc, in Powys; and
Rhys, son of Gruffydd, in South Wales, deserved commendation for
his enterprising and independent spirit.&nbsp; In North Wales,
David, son of Owen, and on the borders of Morgannoc, in South
Wales, Howel, son of Iorwerth of Caerleon, maintained their good
faith and credit, by observing a strict neutrality between the
Welsh and English.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE JOURNEY BY WENLOCH, BRUMFELD, THE
CASTLE OF LUDLOW, AND LEOMINSTER, TO HEREFORD</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Shrewsbury, we continued our
journey towards Wenloch, by a narrow and rugged way, called
Evil-street, where, in our time, a Jew, travelling with the
archdeacon of the place, whose name was Sin (<i>Peccatum</i>),
and the dean, whose name was Devil, towards Shrewsbury, hearing
the archdeacon say, that his archdeaconry began at a place called
Evil-street, and extended as far as Mal-pas, towards Chester,
pleasantly told them, &ldquo;It would be a miracle, if his fate
brought him safe out of a country, whose archdeacon was Sin,
whose dean the devil; the entrance to the archdeaconry
Evil-street, and its exit Bad-pass.&rdquo; <a
name="citation137"></a><a href="#footnote137"
class="citation">[137]</a></p>
<p>From Wenloch, we passed by the little cell of Brumfeld, <a
name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138"
class="citation">[138]</a> <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>the noble castle of Ludlow, through
Leominster to Hereford leaving on our right hand the districts of
Melenyth and Elvel; thus (describing as it were a circle) we came
to the same point from which we had commenced this laborious
journey through Wales.</p>
<p>During this long and laudable legation, about three thousand
men were signed with the cross; well skilled in the use of arrows
and lances, and versed in military matters; impatient to attack
the enemies of the faith; profitably and happily engaged for the
service of Christ, if the expedition of the Holy Cross had been
forwarded with an alacrity equal to the diligence and devotion
with which the forces were collected.&nbsp; But by the secret,
though never unjust, judgment of God, the journey of the Roman
emperor was delayed, and dissensions arose amongst our
kings.&nbsp; The premature and fatal hand of death arrested the
king of Sicily, who had been the foremost sovereign in supplying
the holy land with corn and provisions during the period of their
distress.&nbsp; In consequence of his death, violent contentions
arose amongst our princes respecting their several rights to the
kingdom; and the faithful beyond sea suffered severely by want
and famine, surrounded on all sides by enemies, and most
anxiously waiting for supplies.&nbsp; But as affliction may
strengthen the understanding, as gold is tried by fire, and
virtue may be confirmed in weakness, these things are suffered to
happen; since adversity (as Gregory testifies) opposed to good
prayers is the probation of virtue, not the judgment of
reproof.&nbsp; For who does not know how fortunate a circumstance
it was that <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Paul went to Italy, and suffered so dreadful a
shipwreck?&nbsp; But the ship of his heart remained unbroken
amidst the waves of the sea.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A DESCRIPTION OF BALDWIN, ARCHBISHOP OF
CANTERBURY</span> <a name="citation139"></a><a
href="#footnote139" class="citation">[139]</a></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> it not be thought superfluous
to describe the exterior and inward qualities of that person, the
particulars of whose embassy, and as it were holy peregrination,
we have briefly and succinctly related.&nbsp; He was a man of a
dark complexion, of an open and venerable countenance, of a
moderate stature, a good person, and rather inclined to be thin
than corpulent.&nbsp; He was a modest and grave man, of so great
abstinence and continence, that ill report scarcely ever presumed
to say any thing against him; a man of few words; slow to anger,
temperate and moderate in all his passions and affections; swift
to hear, slow to speak; he was from an early age well instructed
in literature, and bearing the yoke of the Lord from his youth,
by the purity of his morals became a distinguished luminary to
the people; wherefore voluntarily resigning the honour of the
archlevite, <a name="citation140"></a><a href="#footnote140"
class="citation">[140]</a> <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>which he had canonically obtained,
and despising the pomps and vanities of the world, he assumed
with holy devotion the habit of the Cistercian order; and as he
had been formerly more than a monk in his manners, within the
space of a year he was appointed abbot, and in a few years
afterwards preferred first to a bishopric, and then to an
archbishopric; and having been found faithful in a little, had
authority given him over much.&nbsp; But, as Cicero says,
&ldquo;Nature had made nothing entirely perfect;&rdquo; when he
came into power, not laying aside that sweet innate benignity
which he had always shewn when a private man, sustaining his
people with his staff rather than chastising them with rods,
feeding them as it were with the milk of a mother, and not making
use of the scourges of the father, he incurred public scandal for
his remissness.&nbsp; So great was his lenity that he put an end
to all pastoral rigour; and was a better monk than abbot, a
better bishop than archbishop.&nbsp; Hence pope Urban addressed
him; &ldquo;Urban, servant of the servants of God, to the most
fervent monk, to the warm abbot, to the luke-warm bishop, to the
remiss archbishop, health, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This second successor to the martyr Thomas, having heard of
the insults offered to our Saviour and his holy cross, was
amongst the first who signed themselves with the cross, and
manfully assumed the office of preaching its service both at home
and in the most remote parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; Pursuing his
journey to the Holy Land, he embarked on board a vessel at
Marseilles, and landed safely in a port at Tyre, from whence he
proceeded to Acre, where he found our army both attacking and
attacked, our forces dispirited by the defection of the princes,
and thrown into a state of desolation and despair; fatigued by
long expectation of supplies, greatly afflicted by hunger and
want, and distempered by the inclemency of the air: finding his
end approaching, <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>he embraced his fellow subjects, relieving their wants
by liberal acts of charity and pious exhortations, and by the
tenor of his life and actions strengthened them in the faith;
whose ways, life, and deeds, may he who is alone the &ldquo;way,
the truth, and the life,&rdquo; the way without offence, the
truth without doubt, and the life without end, direct in truth,
together with the whole body of the faithful, and for the glory
of his name and the palm of faith which he hath planted, teach
their hands to war, and their fingers to fight.</p>

passed, which time he had spent privilie with his freends,

to the king, that he intended the kingdome of South Wales as his
father had enjoied it, which was now in the king&rsquo;s hands;
and that all the countrie hoped of libertie through him;
therefore the king sent to take him.&nbsp; But Gryffyth ap Rees
hering this, sent to Gruffyth ap Conan, prince of North Wales,
desiring him of his aid, and that he might remaine safelie within
his countrie; which he granted, and received him joiouslie for
his father&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; He afterwards proved so
troublesome and successful an antagonist, that the king
endeavoured by every possible means to get him into his
power.&nbsp; To Gruffyth ap Conan he offered &ldquo;mountaines of
gold to send the said Gruffyth or his head to him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And at a subsequent period, he sent for Owen ap-Cadogan said to
him, &ldquo;Owen, I have found thee true and faithful unto me,
therefore I desire thee to take or kill that murtherer, that doth
so trouble my loving subjects.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Gruffyth escaped
all the snares which the king had laid for him, and in the year
1137 died a natural and honourable death; he is styled in the
Welsh chronicle, &ldquo;the light, honor, and staie of South

have taken his account of the spring, on the summit of this
mountain, from report, rather than from ocular testimony.&nbsp; I
(Sir R. Colt Hoare) examined the summits of each peak very
attentively, and could discern no spring whatever.&nbsp; The soil
is peaty and very boggy.&nbsp; On the declivity of the southern
side of the mountain, and at no considerable distance from the
summit, is a spring of very fine water, which my guide assured me
never failed.&nbsp; On the north-west side of the mountain is a
round pool, in which possibly trout may have been sometimes
found, but, from the muddy nature of its waters, I do not think
it very probable; from this pool issues a small brook, which
falls precipitously down the sides of the mountain, and pursuing
its course through a narrow and well-wooded valley, forms a
pretty cascade near a rustic bridge which traverses it.&nbsp; I

the spring and the pool together.</p>

world knoweth I have not one daughter.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I lie
not (said the priest), for thou hast three daughters: one of them
is called Pride, the second Covetousness, and the third

and barons, and said to them, &lsquo;This hypocrite heere hath

saith) I cherish, nourish, foster, and mainteine; that is to say,
Pride, Covetousness, and Lecherie: and now that I have found out

wholly digressive, we must now recur back to Brecknock, or
rather, perhaps, to our author&rsquo;s residence at Landeu, where
we left him, and from thence accompany him to Abergavenny.&nbsp;
It appears that from Landeu he took the road to Talgarth, a small
village a little to the south east of the road leading from
Brecknock to Hay; from whence, climbing up a steep ascent, now
called Rhiw Cwnstabl, or the Constable&rsquo;s ascent, he crossed
the black mountains of Llaneliew to the source of the Gronwy-fawr
river, which rises in that eminence, and pursues its rapid course
into the Vale of Usk.&nbsp; From thence a rugged and uneven track
descends suddenly into a narrow glen, formed by the torrent of
the Gronwy, between steep, impending mountains; bleak and barren
for the first four or five miles, but afterwards wooded to the
very margin of the stream.&nbsp; A high ledge of grassy hills on
the left hand, of which the principal is called the Bal, or Y
Fal, divides this formidable pass (the &ldquo;Malus passus&rdquo;
of Giraldus) from the vale of Ewyas, in which stands the noble
monastery of Llanthoni, &ldquo;montibus suis inclusum,&rdquo;
encircled by its mountains.&nbsp; The road at length emerging
from this deep recess of Coed Grono, or Cwm Gronwy, the vale of
the river Gronwy, crosses the river at a place called Pont Escob,
or the Bishop&rsquo;s bridge, probably so called from this very
circumstance of its having been now passed by the archbishop and
his suite, and is continued through the forest of Moel, till it
joins the Hereford road, about two miles from Abergavenny.&nbsp;
This formidable defile is at least nine miles in length.</p>
<p><a name="footnote45"></a><a href="#citation45"

a mile above Pont Escob, there is a wood called Coed Dial, or the
Wood of Revenge.&nbsp; Here again, by the modern name of the
place, we are enabled to fix the very spot on which Richard de
Clare was murdered.&nbsp; The Welsh Chronicle informs us, that
&ldquo;in 1135, Morgan ap Owen, a man of considerable quality and
estate in Wales, remembering the wrong and injury he had received
at the hands of Richard Fitz-Gilbert, slew him, together with his
son Gilbert.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first of this great family, Richard
de Clare, was the eldest son of Gislebert, surnamed Crispin, earl
of Brion, in Normandy.&nbsp; This Richard Fitz-Gilbert came into
England with William the Conqueror, and received from him great
advancement in honour and possessions.&nbsp; On the death of the
Conqueror, favouring the cause of Robert Curthose, he rebelled
against William Rufus, but when that king appeared in arms before
his castle at Tunbridge, he submitted; after which, adhering to
Rufus against Robert, in 1091, he was taken prisoner, and shortly
after the death of king Henry I., was assassinated, on his
journey through Wales, in the manner already related.</p>

lord of Over-Went, and built a castle at Abergavenny, on the same
spot where, according to ancient tradition, a giant called Agros
had erected a fortress.&nbsp; He died in the reign of William
Rufus, and was buried in the priory which he had founded at
Abergavenny; having no issue, he gave the aforesaid castle and
lands to Brian de Insula, or Brian de Wallingford, his nephew, by
his sister Lucia.&nbsp; The enormous excesses mentioned by
Giraldus, as having been perpetrated in this part of Wales during
his time, seem to allude to a transaction that took place in the
castle of Abergavenny, in the year 1176, which is thus related by
two historians, Matthew Paris and Hollinshed.&nbsp; &ldquo;<span

oth, &lsquo;That no traveller by the waie amongst them should
beare any bow, or other unlawful weapon,&rsquo; which oth, when
they refused to take, because they would not stand to that
ordinance, he condemned them all to death.&nbsp; This deceit he
used towards them, in revenge of the death of his uncle Henrie of
Hereford, whom upon Easter-even before they had through treason
murthered, and were now acquited was the like

perpetuate the honour of that day, called the place where the

Roderic, or the Stone of Roderic.&rdquo;&nbsp; This account is in
part corroborated by the following communication from Mr. Richard
Llwyd of Beaumaris, who made personal inquiries on the
spot.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cerrig y Borth, being a rough, undulating
district, could not, for that reason, have been chosen for
addressing a multitude; but adjoining it there are two eminences
which command a convenient surface for that purpose; one called
Maen Rodi (the Stone or Rock of Roderic), the property of Owen
Williams, Esq.; and the other Carreg Iago, belonging to Lord
Uxbridge.&nbsp; This last, as now pronounced, means the Rock of
St. James; but I have no difficulty in admitting, that Carreg yr
Arch Iagon may (by the compression of common, undiscriminating
language, and the obliteration of the event from ignorant minds
by the lapse of so many centuries) be contracted into Carreg
Iago.&nbsp; Cadair yr archesgob is now also contracted into
Cadair (chair), a seat naturally formed in the rock, with a rude
arch over it, on the road side, which is a rough terrace over the
breast of a rocky and commanding cliff, and the nearest way from
the above eminences to the insulated church of Landisilio.&nbsp;
This word Cadair, though in general language a chair, yet when
applied to exalted situations, means an observatory, as Cadair
Idris, etc.; but there can, in my opinion, be no doubt that this
seat in the rock is that described by the words Cadair yr
Archesgob.&rdquo;&nbsp; [Still more probable, and certainly more

not in revenues, may deserve the epithet of
&ldquo;paupercula&rdquo; attached to it by Giraldus.&nbsp; From
its situation near the banks of the river Elwy, it derived the
name of Llanelwy, or the church upon the Elwy.</p>
<p><a name="footnote129e"></a><a href="#citation129e"

the archbishop proceeded to the little cell of Basinwerk, where
he and his attendants passed the night.&nbsp; It is situated at a
short distance from Holywell, on a gentle eminence above a
valley, watered by the copious springs that issue from St.
Winefred&rsquo;s well, and on the borders of a marsh, which
extends towards the coast of Cheshire.</p>

North Wales; <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1162, the second
expedition into South Wales; <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1165, the third expedition into North Wales.&nbsp; In the first,
the king was obliged to retreat with considerable loss, and the

to a serious disaster.</p>

Utrecht, and his body was conveyed to Spire for interment.</p>

king Harold as having escaped from the battle of Hastings, and as

fixing the situation of the Album Monasterium, mentioned in the
text, as three churches in the county of Shropshire bore that
appellation; the first at Whitchurch, the second at Oswestry, the
third at Alberbury.&nbsp; The narrative of our author is so
simple, and corresponds so well with the topography of the
country through which they passed, that I think no doubt ought to
be entertained about the course of their route.&nbsp; From
Chester they directed their way to the White Monastery, or
Whitchurch, and from thence towards Oswestry, where they slept,
and were entertained by William Fitz-Alan, after the English mode
of hospitality.</p>

St. Asaph in the year 1186, and died in 1220.&nbsp; He had a

adjoining, which belonged to Meredith ap Blethyn, a Briton.&nbsp;
This Alan, having married the daughter and heir to Warine,
sheriff of Shropshire, had in her right the barony of the same
Warine.&nbsp; To him succeeded William, his son and heir.&nbsp;
He married Isabel de Say, daughter and heir to Helias de Say,
niece to Robert earl of Gloucester, lady of Clun, and left issue

Giraldus as most distinguished in North and South Wales, and most
celebrated in his time, were, 1. Owen, son of Gruffydd, in North
Wales; 2. Meredyth, son of Gruffydd, in South Wales; 3. Owen de
Cyfeilioc, in Powys; 4. Cadwalader, son of Gruffydd, in North
Wales; 5. Gruffydd of Maelor in Powys; 6. Rhys, son of Gruffydd,
in South Wales; 7. David, son of Owen, in North Wales; 8. Howel,
son of Iorwerth, in South Wales.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Owen Gwynedd, son of Gruffydd ap Conan, died in 1169,
having governed his country well and worthily for the space of
thirty-two years.&nbsp; He was fortunate and victorious in all
his affairs, and never took any enterprise in hand but he
achieved it.&nbsp; 2. Meredyth ap Gruffydd ap Rhys, lord of
Caerdigan and Stratywy, died in 1153, at the early age of
twenty-five; a worthy knight, fortunate in battle, just and
liberal to all men.&nbsp; 3. Owen Cyfeilioc was the son of
Gruffydd Meredyth ap Meredyth ap Blethyn, who was created lord of
Powys by Henry I., and died about the year 1197, leaving his
principality to his son Gwenwynwyn, from whom that part of Powys
was called Powys Gwenwynwyn, to distinguish it from Powys Vadoc,
the possession of the lords of Bromfield.&nbsp; The poems
ascribed to him possess great spirit, and prove that he was, as
Giraldus terms him, &ldquo;lingu&aelig; dicacis,&rdquo; in its
best sense.&nbsp; 4. Cadwalader, son of Gruffydd ap Conan, prince
of North Wales, died in 1175.&nbsp; Gruffydd of Maelor was son of
Madoc ap Meredyth ap Blethyn, prince of Powys, who died at
Winchester in 1160.&nbsp; &ldquo;This man was ever the king of
England&rsquo;s friend, and was one that feared God, and relieved
the poor: his body was conveyed honourably to Powys, and buried
at Myvod.&rdquo;&nbsp; His son Gruffydd succeeded him in the
lordship of Bromfield, and died about the year 1190.&nbsp; 6.
Rhys ap Gruffydd, or the lord Rhys, was son of Gruffydd ap Rhys
ap Tewdwr, who died in 1137.&nbsp; The ancient writers have been
very profuse in their praises of this celebrated Prince.&nbsp; 7.
David, son of Owen Gwynedd, who, on the death if his father,
forcibly seized the principality of North Wales, slaying his
brother Howel in battle, and setting aside the claims of the
lawful inheritor of the throne, Iorwerth Trwyndwn, whose son,
Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, in 1194, recovered his inheritance.&nbsp;
8. Howel, son of Iorwerth of Caerleon, appears to have been
distinguished chiefly by his ferocity.</p>

of prebendaries, or secular canons, resided at Bromfield in the
reign of king Henry I.; Osbert, the prior, being recorded as a
witness to a deed made before the year 1148.&nbsp; In 1155, they
became Benedictines, and surrendered church and lands to the
abbey of St. Peter&rsquo;s at Gloucester, whereupon a prior and
monks were placed there, and continued till the
dissolution.&nbsp; An ancient gateway and some remains of the
priory still testify the existence of this religious house, the

Devonshire, of a low family, but being endowed by nature with
good abilities, applied them to an early cultivation of sacred
and profane literature.&nbsp; His good conduct procured him the
friendship of Bartholomew bishop of Exeter, who promoted him to
the archdeaconry of that see; resigning this preferment, he
assumed the cowl, and in a few years became abbot of the
Cistercian monastery at Ford.&nbsp; In the year 1180, he was
advanced to the bishopric of Worcester, and in 1184, translated
to the archiepiscopal see of Canterbury.&nbsp; In the year 1188,
he made his progress through Wales, preaching with fervour the
service of the Cross; to which holy cause he fell a sacrifice in
the year 1190, having religiously, honourably, and charitably
ended his days in the Holy Land.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
